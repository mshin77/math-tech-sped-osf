Although the approach appears to have tremendous potential for learning-disabled math students throughout all realms of education, caution is advised when choosing the time and circumstances of its instigation. Also presented are the advantages found when the ALP approach was compared to the traditional approach of subtracting fractions. "

thesis,"Golden, C. K. ",1982,"The Effect of the Hand-held Calculator on Mathematics Speed, Accuracy, and Motivation of Secondary Educable Mentally Retarded Students (grades 7-9)",,"The purpose of the investigation was to determine the effect of using the hand-held calculator with secondary educable mentally retarded students (grades 7-9) to increase speed, accuracy, and motivation in working algorithmic problems in the four basic areas of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rationale for the study was that the hand-held calculator might be a device that could free the educable mentally retarded student from the laborious tasks necessary to master algorithms, so that time could be devoted to algorithm application and concept development. The population sample was comprised of 50 secondary educable mentally retarded students (23 experimental and 27 control) from Wood County, West Virginia. Four intact class units (2 experimental and 2 control) were randomly selected from eight available junior high schools. The students ranged in IQ from 50-70 and came from middle to low socio-economic backgrounds. A multiple time-series design encompassing two pretests, a treatment, and two post-tests was implemented during twelve weeks. The treatment consisted of systematic calculator instruction in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for the experimental group and traditional instruction in the same areas for the control group. An analysis of covariance was used for interpreting test results. The dependent variables were speed acquisition, speed retention, accuracy acquisition, and accuracy retention. The variables were further examined in relation to total group, grade level, sex, and separate algorithms with pretests being used as covariates. Motivation was examined prior to the administration of the first and second post-tests. The t test was used to determine significance. The analysis of covariance indicated the following differences: (a) the experimental group performed significantly better in multiplication and division for speed acquisition and retention; and (b) the experimental group performed significantly better in total group, grade level, sex, subtraction, multiplication, and division in accuracy acquisition and retention. The t test indicated a positive reaction toward using the calculator. The hand-held calculator appears to be a device that can positively affect multiplication and division speed. It also appears to affect the subtraction, multiplication, and division accuracy for educable mentally retarded males and females in grades 7-9."

The study involved 55 students. Subjects in the Experimental and Control groups were mainstreamed into the regular Fundamental Math I class, and all subjects attended one special education resource class for tutorial assistance. Subjects in the Experimental group received 20 minutes of microcomputer-assisted instruction in math once a week. Subjects in the Control group received no microcomputer-assisted instruction. Both groups received treatment for 15 weeks. The math computation subtest of the California Achievement Test was administered as a pretest prior to the commencement of the study in order to control for initial differences in math achievement level and as a posttest at the completion of the treatment program. Analysis of the data revealed the following conclusions: (1) Students receiving computer-assisted instruction in math exhibited significant gains in achievement when compared to students receiving only traditional math instruction in the regular classroom. Significance at the .05 and .01 level was obtained. (2) The independent variables of group membership, pretest math achievement level, Performance IQ, Full Scale IQ, sex, and race were found to be significant predictors of posttest math achievement when testing at the .05 level. (3) Upon separate analysis, only the predictor variables of pretest math achievement level and Performance IQ were found to be independently related."

Both instructional methods provided highly structured drill and practice of multiplication facts, but differed on several important dimensions: immediacy of feedback, individually-tailored practice of problems, and mode of presentation. A combination group/single-subject methodological approach was employed to determine any idiosyncratic or group performance differences between drill and practice methods or any group differences between learning disabled and normal students. While overall, few differences were found between the instructional methods, they did differ with respect to when learning occurred. Also, individual data suggest that for some of the students, performance varied according to the type of drill and practice employed. The performance of learning disabled and normal subjects was surprisingly similar across measures."

",1984,Computer assisted instruction in arithmetic for specific learning disabilities students in the elementary school,drill vs practice activities during computer assisted instruction.//computation skills.//3rd–5th graders with learning disabilities.//Computer Assisted Instruction.//Elementary School Students.//Learning Disabilities.//Mathematical Ability,"The purpose of this study was to determine if computer assisted instruction via drill and practice activities would significantly improve the computation skills of students with specific learning disabilities. Twenty-six students with specific learning disabilities in grades 3 through 5 received an average of 12 minutes per day of computer assisted instruction in arithmetic. A control group of 12 students with specific learning disabilities in grades 3 through 5 practiced an average of 12 minutes a day with computer generated worksheets. The supplemental instruction was provided for 8 weeks. Students were tested at 2-week intervals with criterion referenced tests designed to measure computational skills in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A nonparametric statistical design based on ranks was employed for the data analysis because the sample size was small and from a nonnormal population. The results of the statistical analysis indicated that significant differences existed in posttest scores of grade 3 experimental and control groups. The comparison within grades 4 and 5 was not statistically significant. A clinical investigation was also conducted. Results of this investigation indicated that computer assisted instruction resulted in substantial increases in arithmetic achievement for students in grades 3, 4, and 5. Students in the experimental groups identified through psychoeducational assessment as having a noticeable strength in the visual modality achieved substantial increases in arithmetic achievement in the first 4 weeks of the study. It was also found that rote learning of arithmetic facts was increased significantly in the experimental groups."

This process can alert the teacher to the intuitive problem-solving steps that the student may omit. Teaching students to write simple programs can also foster logical thinking and provide students with confidence in their basic skills. "

Following the training of their teachers and after they had completed pretests (the Mathematics sections of the ITBS, WRAT, PIAT and a Basic Facts Test), the students in four Educable Mentally Handicapped and five Learning Disabilities classrooms used Apple II Plus microcomputers for a minimum of a half hour per week for approximately the next year and one-half. In order to develop each experimental student's skills to compensate for those capabilities which were absent or diminished due to his handicapping condition and to provide compensatory tutoring as needed, computer drills, tutorials, and other programs were chosen by the Special Education teacher after consultation with that student's regular teacher. Non-computer control groups of similar structure and composition to the experimental groups were also monitored. Posttesting was concluded in May of 1982. The overall design was conceived as a two-way Factorial ANOVA with one between factor (treatment) and one within factor (time). The following conclusions were drawn: After being trained, both Learning Disabilities and Educable Mentally Handicapped students of all levels, K - 12, are capable of using Computer Assisted Instruction with a minimum of supervision. Most students remained interested and enthusiastic about computer use even after the novelty effect had worn off, even after two years of use. Parents were very supportive of computer use by their handicapped children. The effects of computer use on mathematics achievement was generally positive, with 15 of 17 significant TREATMENT * TIME interactions found favoring the computer using Experimental Groups. The Experimental Groups made significantly more gains (p < .001) than the Control Groups at all but the senior high level. Effects were found when students used the computer at least a half hour per week. The attitude towards computer use of the teacher and his commitment to it were important factors in its effectiveness. The use of computers with Learning Disabilities and Educable Mentally Handicapped students exposed no detrimental effects; in fact, it appears to offer great promise for the future."
thesis,"Powell-Rahlfs, K. ",1984,Computer assisted and traditional instruction of multiplication facts with learning disabled elementary students,computer assisted instruction.//mathematics achievement.//learning disabled elementary school students.//Elementary School Students.//Learning Disabilities.//Mathematics Education,"Research has indicated that computer assisted instruction can provide many elements of instruction necessary for aiding the learning disabled student. The microcomputer can provide repetition, it provides motivation and immediate feedback, is an effective means of increasing retention, and is more effective with low ability students than average or high ability students. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of different forms of computer assisted instruction on elementary learning disabled students' knowledge multiplication facts. The problem was approached by exposing learning disabled students, to one of three methods of treatment (a computer assisted drill and practice program, a computer assisted instructional game, and flashcards), or to the control group. Treatment was fifteen minutes per day for five days. A pretest was administered prior to treatment, a posttest and an attitude inventory was administered immediately following treatment, and a second posttest was administered four days following treatment. Student attitude toward school, math, microcomputers, and themselves were measured by administration of semantic differential attitude inventory. Analysis of data using a repeated measures, analysis of covariance, revealed no significant differences among the four groups in achievement or in retention of material, however, delayed posttest scores for all groups were greater than scores on the posttest immediately following treatment. The data detected no significant differences in attitude among the four groups. Although there were no significant differences in attitude, a graph of the responses revealed an interesting pattern. All subjects rated math the highest of the four concepts, and attitude toward self was rated second highest. With the exception of the control group, the lowest rated concept was school. The control group rated microcomputers lowest. The following conclusions were made: (1) Achievement gains for the three experimental and the control groups do not appear to differ. (2) Administration of the pretest, posttest 1, posttest 2, and the attitude inventory may have had a significant impact on achievement. (3) Student attitude toward school, math, microcomputers, or themselves do not differ significantly."

One possible cause of learning problems in both reading and math is failure of learning disabled students to develop automaticity in basic skills. Automaticity is acquired through repeated practice. As learning disabled students appear to experience difficulty in developing automated skills, it was necessary to either provide them with more opportunities to practice basic skills or with more effective and efficient drill and practice. The microcomputer is ideally suited to provide optimal conditions for practice in basic math skills. Moreover, investigations of microcomputer use in classrooms suggests that drill and practice games are predominately used for this purpose. This study investigated the effectiveness of embedding a drill and practice task within a game environment. Thirty learning disabled and 30 nondisabled students were identified who had conceptual understanding of addition but had not achieved automaticity in addition facts. Students were trained on either a drill and practice game or a plain drill program. Development of automaticity was assessed on three modes of responding--oral, computer keyboard, and written response. Significant reduction in latency of response for each group occurred over the course of the training program. Program effects for nondisabled students varied across three dependent measures, however learning disabled students were consistently disadvantaged by training on the drill and practice game. It was hypothesized that learning disabled students' performance could be attributed to attentional deficits, particularly selective attention problems. It appears that the game provided a sufficiently distracting environment to significantly interfere with learning disabled students' skill acquisition. While computers have the potential to provide excellent conditions for drill and practice, care must be taken in evaluating programs which emphasize sophisticated graphic embellishments rather than instructional quality. Such programs could have deleterious effects on the skill acquisition of learning disabilities students."

A multiple baseline design across subjects with a follow-up was employed in an applied behavioral setting. The subjects were two female and two male learning disabled adolescents enrolled in a public high school. Achievement was measured using investigator-made tests. The number of correct responses made during baseline and intervention phases were recorded on graphs. Results indicated that selected computer games were effective as an instructional strategy for these learning disabled students who had poor knowledge of multiplication and division facts. The students demonstrated improved performance and maintained this performance level thirty days after the intervention was discontinued. It was concluded that selected computer games provide a viable supplement to classroom instruction as a means of improving learning disabled adolescents' achievement in multiplication and division facts.

Research which has focused on providing rewards to enhance performance of learning disabled children is mixed. Some studies found improved performance with reward while others report that learning disabled children made more interstimulus and redundant responses under reward contingencies. There are a number of problems in comparing and evaluating past research, including issues around heterogeneity of subjects, wide variation in task complexity and the fact that the majority of studies confound institution of reward with practice effects. This dissertation is a study of the effects of reward on performance of a mathematics task by learning disabled children while working in two different modalities of task presentation, with a computer and with a tutor. Physiological measures, specifically skin conductance level skin conductance level and skin conductance responses were employed as an index of arousal, thought to be a further indication of motivation. Performance and arousal measures were compared for the tutor versus the computer modalities. The studies were run consecutively. Subjects were learning disabled children who were attending an intensive after school remedial program at the State University of New York at Binghamton. The task was a simple drill of single digit multiplication or addition, expanding upon competency of the subjects. The computer presentation of the task consisted of colorful video-game type format. Identical problems were presented by the tutor on flashcards. All subjects worked with both the tutor and computer every session with order counterbalanced. In order to decrease the influence of practice a performance task was employed and a number of sessions were conducted over days. Results are discussed in terms of the positive role of external motivators in eliciting optimum performance from learning disabled children and implications for academic program planning. Finally the influence of social demand characteristics which appeared to be operating in the tutor modality for these subjects is contrasted with conflicting findings for more socially impaired (autistic) subjects."

Practice that allows students to use counting strategies for solving problems does nothing but strengthen student's use of counting strategies and does little to move the students toward a state of automaticity. The authors believed that children with learning handicaps can attain automaticity at a level equal to their normal peers if care is taken to provide these children with appropriate instruction prior to placing them in drill and practice activities."
thesis,"Moore, L. J. ",1988,A comparison of two empirically validated approaches to teaching ratios and proportions to secondary remedial and learning disabled students,videodisc program vs active teaching paradigm.//mathematics achievement.//remedial & learning disabled high school students.//Learning Disabilities.//Mathematics Education.//Remedial Education.//Special Education.//Teaching Methods.//High School Students,"This study compared two curricula designed to teach ratio and proportion word problems. The experimental curriculum incorporated instructional design variables which have been shown to be most effective in teaching students; e.g., teaching discreet strategies in small steps. This curriculum was presented via an interactive videodisc program. The comparison curriculum was derived from four math basals and was taught following an active teaching paradigm. The curricula were matched for content and length. The subjects included 29 secondary students who qualified for remedial or special education services in math. The subjects were matched based on scores from a preskills test and the math portion of the Metropolitan Achievement Test and then randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. There were 16 students in the basal group and 13 students in the videodisc group. During the intervention data was collected on the groups' on-task behavior, levels of appropriate teacher implementation, and written work. At the end of the six-week intervention students were administered a 21-item posttest. Teachers and students completed questionnaires regarding their perceptions of the two curricula. A parallel form of the posttest was administered as a maintenance test ten school days after the completion of the study. The students in the videodisc group performed significantly higher on the posttest and insignificantly higher on the maintenance test than students in the basal group. Means for the videodisc group on work samples were consistently above 80%, while means for the basal group showed a downward trend with means falling from 90% to 72%. Descriptive measures showed the percentage of on-task behavior for the videodisc and basal groups to be 76% and 68% respectively, with percentages of off-task behavior 10% and 20% respectively. Appropriate levels of teacher implementation were found for both groups. While the teachers felt strongly that the videodisc program was instructionally superior, they missed the greater interactions with students the basal curriculum afforded them. On the student questionnaire, a greater percentage of students in the videodisc group than in the basal group indicated they now felt able to successfully work proportion word problems."

Ss were trained on either a drill-and-practice game or an unadorned straightforward drill program. Automaticity was assessed in 3 modes of responding: oral, computer keyboard, and written response. There was a significant interaction effect indicating that the learning disabled Ss were relatively disadvantaged by repeated practice in the game format. It is inferred that learning disabled Ss' lower performance is attributed to attentional difficulties, particularly selective attention problems, when potentially distracting elements of a game environment are present.

Twenty-three normal and 29 learning disabled children solved 40 computer-presented simple addition problems. Strategies, and their associated solution times, used in problem solving were recorded on a trial-by-trial basis and each was classified in accordance with the distributions of associations model of strategy choices. Based on performance in a remedial education course, as indexed by achievement test scores, the learning disabled sample was reclassified into a learning disabled-improved group and an learning disabled-no-change group. No substantive differences comparing the normal and learning disabled-improved groups occurred in the distribution of strategy choices, strategy characteristics (e.g., error rates), or rate of information processing. The performance characteristics of the learning disabled-no-change group, as compared to the two remaining groups, included frequent counting and memory retrieval errors, frequent use of an immature computational strategy, poor strategy choices, and a variable rate of information processing. These performance characteristics were discussed in terms of the strategy choice model and in terms of potential long-term memory and working memory capacity deficits. In addition, implications for remedial education in mathematics were discussed."

Additionally, the study addressed whether students with learning disabilities had higher retention level problems mastered during computer-assisted instruction than those problems mastered during teacher-assisted instructional procedure; the number of problems completed, correctly or incorrectly during respective baselines and interventions; and whether there were differences in mathematics computation test scores between highly structured teacher-assisted instructional procedure, when teacher-assisted instructional procedure was designed to follow the same consistent prompting and feedback procedures as highly structured computer-assisted instruction. Six students from a Public Junior High School, who had specific learning disabilities in mathematics, participated in this study. One loosely structured and one highly structured computer program in multiplication was developed by the investigator to teach multiplication skills to the subjects. The loosely structured program presented consequences and feedback similar to traditional instruction. The highly structured program was programmed to praise every correct response, provide corrective feedback by prompting every incorrect response, and modeled solutions for the problem after the student failed to respond correctly after the second prompt. These same instructional and feedback procedures were employed in the teacher-assisted instructional procedure Baseline and the teacher-assisted instructional procedure Intervention conditions. Multiple baseline design was used in the present study. The subjects were randomly assigned to two sets of three students for treatment purposes. The subjects in each set received treatments as specified in the order of treatments (computer-assisted instruction or teacher-assisted instructional procedure). Tables and line and bar graphs were used to analyze data. The mean, range, and trends of data were evaluated. Results indicated that in terms of achievement gains, computer-assisted instruction Intervention was slightly more effective than teacher-assisted instructional procedure Intervention over their respective baseline means; both interventions were equally effective in terms of relative number of problems completed by each student; and five out of the six students had higher retention level of multiplication problems mastered during computer-assisted instruction than they did on those mastered during teacher-assisted instructional procedure."

All students were pre- and post-tested using both paper and pencil and the calculator on a series of computation and word problem items. Results indicated a significant effect of the calculator on computation achievement. The results for problem solving were less clear. The majority of students who missed problem solving items on the post-test using the calculator used the incorrect algorithm. Students in the treatment groups mastered the use of the calculator with efficiency. These results confirm that students with learning disabilities can master the calculator with efficiency and that the calculator had a significant effect on the calculation achievement of students with learning disabilities. Results also indicate a need to teach students with learning disabilities problem solving skills."

",1992,Coaching Secondary Special Education Teachers in Implementation of an Innovative Videodisc Mathematics Curriculum,,"This article reports case studies of four secondary-level special education teachers who received “coaching” as they implemented an innovative videodisc instructional program dealing with basic fraction concepts and operations. An exploratory, interrupted time series design was used in investigating the effects of regular observations and feedback on the teachers' use of the program. The coach---an experienced special education teacher with expertise in videodisc technology and instructional design---spent some time assisting each teacher with basic issues related to utilization of the technology. However, the majority of her efforts focused on sharing observational data with the teachers on their use of instructional approaches incorporated in the curriculum and found to lead to enhanced achievement in mathematics (Good, Grouws, & Ebmeier, 1983). Results suggest that the coaching led to positive changes in several important teaching techniques and, in some cases, to enhanced use of motivational strategies and classroom management techniques. Growth was noted, as well, in observed rates of student engagement. A semistructured interview assessing the teachers' reactions to and perceptions of the intervention indicated that they found the coaching procedure beneficial. The results also point out that teachers may be more open to receiving feedback on their teaching during the introduction of a new instructional technology, rather than in the context of conventional curricula."

Three teachers, whose classes contained mainstreamed students with mild disabilities, used the computer networking system to check student understanding of math concepts throughout their math lessons. A multiple baseline design across subjects (teachers) was used to assess the effects of using of the networking system on the time teachers spent on active teaching, feedback and explanations, the number of problems given and number of questions asked. Merely using the networking system led to changes in performance for only one of three teachers. In a second phase, using the networking system with coaching, teachers required students to meet a criterion (usually 80%) to determine whether students needed reteaching or were ready for instruction on a new problem type. Although insufficient data points were available for the third teacher, the results suggest that with coaching on how to use the data generated by the computer networking system, teachers increased the amount of time spent on active teaching, providing feedback, number of problems given, and number of questions asked. Teachers reported that the data shown on the monitor screen enabled them to more precisely determine whether students understood skills presented during the lesson."

The students classified as educable mental handicaps (five females and two males) were enrolled in a self-contained special education class in a junior high school. Forty-four eighth-grade general education students were selected from the same school to participate in a preexperimental, noninstructional, peer group assessment. An ABCD, single-case experimental design was used, with multiple probes introduced at staggered intervals. Days per phase ranged from 4 to 10. Two maintenance phases were scheduled, the first immediately after the last instructional phase, and the second 26 days later. The results indicated significant differences in performance favoring calculators over pencil and paper for each student classified as educable mental handicaps. No difference in performance was found for the sample of general education students across computational modes. However, a split point (cutoff score) was found at 17.5 correct digits per minute with pencil and paper, which predicted a student's best computational mode. Rehearsal and visual cues significantly influenced correct performance for only one student classified as educable mental handicaps. Maintenance of correct performance with calculators over time was excellent for each pupil. A positive relationship was found between the number of head swings used to input digits into a calculator and computational time. Without calculators, the students classified as educable mental handicaps were markedly inferior to their general education peers. However, with calculators the performances were equivalent. Several clinical issues involved in conventional and calculator instruction for students with special needs are discussed."

Twenty-nine school-identified students with learning disabilities from five urban schools participated in the study. The sample's mean age was 13.3 years. After blocking on initial attributional patterns, students were randomly assigned to a mathematics computer-assisted instruction program that provided either attribution retraining or neutral feedback. Students used their assigned program for eight 30-minute sessions. Results did not support the contention that attribution retraining would have a significant impact an students' attributions. However, students who participated in the attribution retraining condition completed significantly more levels of the program than their counterparts who received neutral feedback. Attribution retraining students also obtained significantly higher scores on a test of problems practiced during the computer-assisted instruction program. These results suggest that attribution retraining may be a desirable addition to the type of feedback typically provided by computer-assisted instruction programs. However they also highlight the need for further research that examines the conditions under which specific attributions are most advantageous"

The results showed that in test situations with modelling facilities the children who received External-Modelling instruction outperformed the other children, whereas on a test without those facilities the children who received Text-Analysis instruction performed better than the other children. It is argued that children who received Text-Analysis training learned to construct problem representations mentally, which they may also use in the paper-and-pencil Situations, whereas children who received External-Modelling training were handicapped in these situations because they were still dependent on the presence of materials with which they could construct a representation of the problem externally.

The hybrid model we propose embeds, or situates, important skill learning in meaningful contexts. We discuss some examples of instructional approaches to complex mathematical problem solving that make use of meaningful contexts. Evaluation data on these approaches have yielded positive and encouraging results for students with learning disabilities as well as general education students.

Subsequent to baseline observations of math performance during self-assessment with and without accuracy feedback, students were trained in self-assessment procedures by way of a series of computer-interactive tutorials. During treatment, students were provided computer-displayed accuracy feedback plus reinforcement for correct self-assessments of their math performance. Reinforcement and feedback were gradually leaned, and in the final treatment condition, accuracy feedback was terminated; however, monetary reinforcement for correct self-assessment was sustained. Following treatment, students were given opportunities to perform math problems in the absence of reinforcement while self-assessing their performances with and without accuracy feedback. This was succeeded by a withdrawal condition and a final session in which students, again, were given an opportunity to self-assess with and without feedback from the computer. Outcomes suggest that subsequent to training computer-interactive self-assessment with feedback may facilitate high rates and long durations of math performance even in the absence of compensation. Implications regarding the augmental as a type of rule-governed behavior and the necessary and sufficient conditions for sustaining self-assessment as a learned reinforcer are discussed. "

The effectiveness of word-problem-solving instruction in 25 outcome studies was examined across student characteristics (e.g., grade, IQ); instructional features (e.g., intervention approach, treatment length); methodological features; skill maintenance; and generalization components. Separate analyses were performed for group-design studies and single-subject studies using standardized mean change and percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND), respectively. The overall mean weighted effect size (d) and PND for word-problem-solving instruction were positive across the group-design studies (ES = +.89) and single-subject studies (PND = 89%). In addition, positive effects for skill maintenance and generalization were found for group design (ES = +.78 and +.84, respectively) and single-subject studies (PND = 100%). Computer-assisted instruction was found to be most effective for group-design studies. Effects for representation techniques and strategy training were found to be significantly higher than the “other” approach for both group-design and single-subject studies. Long-term (> 1 month) intervention effects were significantly higher than short- or intermediate-term interventions for group-design studies, whereas both long-term and intermediate treatments were seen to be more effective than short-term treatments for single-subject studies. Other significant effects found for group-design studies only in terms of student characteristics, instructional features, and methodological features are reported. Finally, implications of the current analysis for future research in the area of word-problem solving are discussed.  "

Students were presented with computer games that varied in terms of contextualization, personalization and provision of choice. Contextualization consisted of providing games in two rich fantasy contexts; personalization consisted of providing personal referents about the students; and provision of choice consisted of enabling students to make non-instructional choices in the games. The design consisted of a 2 (Personalization) x 2 (Choice) factorial design with a no treatment control group. Eighty-three fourth through sixth grade students, forty-seven males and thirty-six females, participated. In addition, forty-six parents participated. Parents, who were blind to the condition in which their children were placed, were asked their opinions about the games. It was hypothesized that the experimental groups would show increased intrinsic motivation, task involvement, self-efficacy and learning compared to the control group. It was also hypothesized that parents of children in the experimental groups would find the games more efficacious. The study showed significant positive effects in the areas of intrinsic motivation, task involvement and self-efficacy. The expectation that parents of children in the experimental groups would believe that the games were more efficacious was also supported. In addition, there was a main effect for choice in six out of six measures of intrinsic motivation, one out of two measures of self-efficacy, and two out of six measures of task involvement. Whether the effect on students' learning of math skills can be considered significant is a more complex issue in the interpretation of the study's findings. All groups improved significantly from pretest to post-tests, yet there were no significant differences among groups in rate of improvement. Nonetheless, students in the experimental conditions significantly outperformed students in the control condition with regard to the number of problems solved correctly while playing on the computer. Finally, the educational implications of the study are discussed. "

Qualitative research strategies embedded in a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control-group design permitted investigators to describe and compare the problem-solving performances of individual students with disabilities in general education settings. Previous research has suggested that students with disabilities can solve math problems that are meaningful and motivating in remedial settings; however, few studies have examined whether those improvements can be achieved in general education classrooms. Results of this study indicated that the students without disabilities profited from contextualized instruction, but benefits for the students with disabilities were equivocal. Explanations for these findings are offered, and implications for instruction are described.  "

A small-group problem-solving tutoring treatment incorporated explicit instruction on problem-solution rules and on transfer. The transfer component was designed to increase awareness of the connections between novel and familiar problems by broadening the categories by which students group problems requiring the same solution methods and by prompting students to search novel problems for these broad categories. To create a stringent test of efficacy, we incorporated a computer-assisted practice condition, which provided students with direct practice on real-world problem-solving tasks. We randomly assigned 40 students to problem-solving tutoring, computer-assisted practice, problem-solving tutoring plus computer-assisted practice, or control, and pre- and posttested students on three problem-solving tasks. On story problems and transfer story problems, tutoring (with or without computer-assisted practice) effected reliably stronger growth compared to control; effects on real-world problem solving, although moderate to large, were not statistically significant. Computer-assisted practice added little value beyond tutoring but, alone, yielded moderate effects on two measures. "

This math concept curriculum-based measure was administered to 171 students in eighth grade. Scores were correlated with scores from a computer adaptive test designed in conjunction with the state to approximate the official statewide mathematics achievement test. Correlations for general education students and students with learning disabilities were high. Regression analysis showed that relatively few of the 11 items were needed to predict computer adaptive test scores. Implications for students with learning disabilities, who traditionally receive little instruction in conceptual understanding, are discussed. "

According to the math Standards (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000), accuracy with basic facts is a critical element in the development of new skills and achievement in higher levels of math. One avenue for improving accuracy on basic skills is computer-assisted instruction. computer-assisted instruction offers an alternative to the teacher-intensive coaching often required to facilitate self-directed performance on basic skills. This paper demonstrates that computer-assisted instruction provides an effective mechanism for teaching students a mnemonic memory strategy to increase their independent performance and accuracy on tasks of basic multiplication.

It also explored how multimedia computer technology could be a potential supplemental teaching aid that teachers could use in addition to traditional classroom instruction. It focused particular attention on how students with learning disability perceived mathematics in grades ninth through twelfth. All participants completed the following instruments: The Mathematics Perception Questionnaire; the Multimedia Demographic Questionnaire; and the High School Subject Test: Algebra I Form B 1988 edition, initially developed by American Testronics and revised and copyrighted by American College Testing (ACT) in 1990. The study used a 2 x 2 x 4 (type of instruction by gender by grade) pretest-posttest factorial design. Ninety participants from two schools were assigned to two nonequivalent groups: a multimedia instructional technology group and a regular classroom instruction group. The sample was composed of male and female students with learning disabilities in grades ninth through twelve. To obtain a descriptive picture of the data, univariate and bivariate analysis of the data were employed. The Mathematics Perception Questionnaire yielded a Cronbach's alpha of .7969. The independent variables in this study were gender, method of instruction (multimedia vs. regular classroom instruction), and grade levels (9, 10, 11, and 12). The dependent variables in this study were: a summed Algebra I Problem-Solving Skills posttest composite variable, a summed Algebra I Problem-Solving Skills pretest covariate and a composite mean mathematics perception variable. Two independent samples t tests were performed to assess differences in mathematics perception by gender and then by method of instruction (multimedia group vs. regular classroom instruction group). A One Way ANOVA was employed to measure differences in mathematics perception between grade levels. The results of the two independent samples t tests showed no statistically significant differences in perceived level of mathematics difficulty for either method of instruction or gender. The results of the One-Way ANOVA also showed no significant differences in perceived level of mathematics difficulty by grade level. A 2 x 2 x 4 ANCOVA factorial design was performed to assess differences on the summed post-test measure of Algebra I Problem-Solving Skills with group, gender and grade as the individual factors and the summed pretest measure as the covariate. None of the main effects (method of instruction, gender, and grade) were statistically significant at the .05 level. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant at the .05 level. Implications and recommendations for future investigations were also discussed. "

Here we describe the cognitive and algorithmic principles underlying the development of similar software for dyscalculia. Our software is based on current understanding of the cerebral representation of number and the hypotheses that dyscalculia is due to a ""core deficit"" in number sense or in the link between number sense and symbolic number representations.; Methods: ""The Number Race"" software trains children on an entertaining numerical comparison task, by presenting problems adapted to the performance level of the individual child. We report full mathematical specifications of the algorithm used, which relies on an internal model of the child's knowledge in a multidimensional ""learning space"" consisting of three difficulty dimensions: numerical distance, response deadline, and conceptual complexity (from non-symbolic numerosity processing to increasingly complex symbolic operations).; Results: The performance of the software was evaluated both by mathematical simulations and by five weeks of use by nine children with mathematical Learning Difficulties. The results indicate that the software adapts well to varying levels of initial knowledge and learning speeds. Feedback from children, parents and teachers was positive. A companion article describes the evolution of number sense and arithmetic scores before and after training.; Conclusion: The software, open-source and freely available online, is designed for learning disabled children aged 5-8, and may also be useful for general instruction of normal preschool children.

Here we review the evidence for this hypothesis, and present results from an initial open-trial test of the software in a sample of nine 7-9 year old children with mathematical difficulties. Methods: Children completed adaptive training on numerical comparison for half an hour a day, four days a week over a period of five-weeks. They were tested before and after intervention on their performance in core numerical tasks: counting, transcoding, base-10 comprehension, enumeration, addition, subtraction, and symbolic and non-symbolic numerical comparison. Results: Children showed specific increases in performance on core number sense tasks. Speed of subitizing and numerical comparison increased by several hundred msec. Subtraction accuracy increased by an average of 23%. Performance on addition and base-10 comprehension tasks did not improve over the period of the study. Conclusion: Initial open-trial testing showed promising results, and suggested that the software was successful in increasing number sense over the short period of the study. However these results need to be followed up with larger, controlled studies. The issues of transfer to higher-level tasks, and of the best developmental time window for intervention also need to be addressed. "

School systems are increasingly being encouraged to provide technology resources to their students. Physically providing computer software systems for student use does not guarantee that these programs will have an impact on student learning or they will be properly implemented. Two separate studies were conducted to determine how an integrated learning system impacted the mathematics achievement of students receiving special education services in math. The first study compared the growth of students' standardized testing scores from Spring 2005 to Spring 2006 between the integrated learning system group (n = 56) and the comparison group (n = 43). Students were receiving special education services for either a primary disability area of a Specific Learning Disability or an Other Health Disability in a Midwestern elementary school setting (grades 3-6). Results indicated no significant difference between the integrated learning system and comparison groups' growth scores. The second part of the study investigated 10 students' math achievement in relation to the math skills practiced, either solely on the integrated learning system or through the integrated learning system and teacher instruction. Students in the second part of the study were receiving special education services in the primary disability area of a Specific Learning Disability or an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Descriptive data gathered suggested that students gained math skills when the integrated learning system was combined with teacher instruction. The discussion focuses on integrated learning system features that were barriers for students with special education needs and how an integrated learning system can be differentiated to become accessible for all learners."

We also discuss the nature and focus of math interventions and implications for both research and practice based on the findings. "

As a result, the majority of students with mild disabilities are educated in the general classroom, and elementary teachers are responsible for helping them succeed in the grade-level curriculum. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards stress the use of technology for mathematics instruction at all grade levels, and middle and high school mathematics teachers use graphing calculators extensively. In this article, the author discusses why it is important for elementary education teachers to introduce early calculators with modifications for students with mild disabilities.  "

The Blending Assessment with Instruction Program intervention incorporated web-based lessons for teachers, online tutorials for students, and classroom management system into standards-based mathematics instruction. The focus was to determine the effectiveness of the design, content and usability as measured by teacher perceptions and outcome data of participating students. Student outcomes were measured by performance on pretests and posttests and statewide mathematics assessments. A secondary purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on (a) students with disabilities who receive their math instruction in the general education classroom and (b) students who qualify for free lunch. These two subgroups were identified to evaluate whether the intervention significantly impacted the population of students involved in the achievement gaps in math. The study was part of a more comprehensive pilot test of Blending Assessment with Instruction Program in grades 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. A total of 222 eighth-grade students from the three schools in Kansas participated in the pilot test. The teachers included four general education and special education classroom teachers. The study utilized a quasi-experimental comparison-group design to measure the impact of Blending Assessment with Instruction Program on eighth-grade student math achievement. Data were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of Blending Assessment with Instruction Program relative to student performance on a pre/post test, 2006-2007 state assessment, and teacher perceptions and satisfaction of the intervention. The results of the pilot study did not show a statistically significant achievement difference on the overall state math assessment score or the select indicator score between students who received the Blending Assessment with Instruction Program intervention vs. the comparison group of students who did not. However, although significant differences were not found between the intervention and the comparison groups, significant differences did exist between the posttest scores of the subgroups of students who received the Blending Assessment with Instruction Program intervention. Additionally, the tutorial data suggested a strong correlation between the Blending Assessment with Instruction Program tutorials and select indicators. "

There are in excess of 6 million students who receive special education services in the United States (U.S. Department of Education, 2001), and between 5% and 10% of school children experience some type of mathematical learning disability (Geary, 2004; Kroesbergen & Luit, 2003). In addition to problems with conceptualization, speed of processing, and effective use of strategies, one of the deficiencies that can negatively affect the performance of these students is fact retrieval. Research indicates that the ability to succeed in higher level math skills is directly related to the student's ability to effectively use lower level mathematics skills such as basic facts (Hasselbring, 1987; Hasselbring, Lott, & Zydney, 2006; Mattingly & Bott, 1990). The purpose of this research was to study the effects of Computer-Assisted Instruction on Learning Disabled students' performance in mathematics. Specifically, this study investigated whether using computer-assisted instruction could significantly affect the students' achievement levels on the Measures of Academic Progress test. The population consisted of 190 students enrolled in an elementary school in the Low Country of South Carolina. The participants were divided into two groups: (1) 165 students in grades 3 through 5 regular classes who did not receive computer-assisted instruction and (2) 25 students in grades 3 through 5 placed in the Learning Disabilities Resource Program who did receive computer-assisted instruction. All students were pre-tested on the Measures of Academic Progress. The experimental group received instruction on the FACTMASTER® CD-ROM program. The Measure of Academic Progress test was utilized to measure pre-treatment and post-treatment achievement levels. The following research questions were addressed: (1) Do significant differences exist between the pre-test and post-test scores for those Learning Disabled students receiving computer-assisted instruction and those students in the regular education class who do not receive computer-assisted instruction at the third, fourth, and fifth grade level? (2) Do significant differences exist between the pre-test and post-test scores for those Learning Disabled students receiving computer-assisted instruction and those students in the regular education class who do not receive computer-assisted instruction at the third grade level? (3) Do significant differences exist between the pre-test and post-test scores for those Learning Disabled students receiving computer-assisted instruction and those students in the regular education class who do not receive computer-assisted instruction at the fourth grade level? (4) Do significant differences exist between the pre-test and post-test scores for those Learning Disabled students receiving computer-assisted instruction and those students in the regular education class who do not receive computer-assisted instruction at the fifth grade level? The primary instrument was the Measured Academic Performance Test. Independent samples t tests were conducted in order to compare the means of the pre-test to post-test gains of the groups involved.

Some studies have used computer-based problem solving instructional programs.; Aim: To analyze in students with learning disabilities the efficacy of a cognitive strategies training for problem solving, with three instructional delivery formats: a teacher-directed program, a computer-assisted instructional program, and a combined program (teacher-directed + computer-assisted instruction).; Subjects and Methods: Forty-four children with mathematics learning disabilities, between 8 and 10 years old participated in this study. The children were randomly assigned to one of the three instructional formats and a control group without cognitive strategies training. In the three instructional conditions which were compared all the students learnt problems solving linguistic and visual cognitive strategies trough the self-instructional procedure. Several types of measurements were used for analysing the possible differential efficacy of the three instructional methods implemented: solving problems tests, marks in mathematics, internal achievement responsibility scale, and school behaviours teacher ratings.; Results and Conclusions: Our findings show that the teacher-directed training group and the teacher-directed + computer-assisted instruction group improved significantly on math word problem solving and on marks in Maths from pre- to post-testing. In addition, the results indicated that the students of the teacher-directed + computer-assisted instruction group solved more real-life problems and developed more internal attributions compared to both control and computer-assisted instruction groups. Finally, with regard to school behaviours, improvements in school adjustment and learning problems were observed in the students of the group with a combined instructional format (teacher-directed + computer-assisted instruction)."

A systematic search of the literature on computer-assisted instructional interventions for students with learning disabilities yielded 25 studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The studies were analyzed on an identified set of evidence-based instructional components validated in the effective teaching research. Overall, the results suggest that most of the identified evidence-based instructional components are incorporated into computer-assisted instruction programs used to teach mathematics to students with learning disabilities. Additionally, the results indicate that computer-assisted instruction is a generally effective means for increasing the mathematical performance of students with learning disabilities. Although promising, the implications for practice based on this analysis are limited by the relatively small number of studies reviewed and the diverse array of mathematical concepts and skills targeted. Findings from this analysis highlight the need for continued development and research validation of computer-assisted instruction programs focusing on improving learning outcomes of students with learning disabilities."

For these students, computers may be valued as a learning tool that diminishes frustration in mathematics. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 has increased the pressures of educating all students, including students with learning disabilities, within all content areas. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2000) reinforces the importance of learning mathematics through the integration of technology. Vygotsky's Social Development Theory, Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, Piaget's developmental stages, and Spiro et al.'s Cognitive Flexibility Theory of Learning (1987) support multimedia-based, computer-based instruction  for improving student success. Further, computer-based instruction promotes motivational behaviors through features such as text, animation, sound, graphics and video. This pretest-posttest control group study assessed the effectiveness of a computer-based math intervention targeting the numbering skills, computation skills, and motivational levels for elementary students with a learning disability. The researcher conducted a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in mathematics ability and/or motivation for learning mathematics between the students within the control group versus the treatment group. The treatment group participated in a nine week, computer-based intervention: Basic Picture Math (Hohlt, 2005) and Theme Park Math (Griggs, 2006). All participants were administered the Test of Early Mathematics Ability - Third Edition (TEMA-3) and student questionnaire both pre-treatment and post-treatment (Pro-ed Inc., 2006). Findings suggested that learning disabled students demonstrated an improvement in mathematics ability and motivational levels after utilizing the intervention. Contributions of the study include benefiting educational research in the areas of special education, technology, and mathematics. "

To support adaptive case-based learning in the proposed problem-based e-learning and to adequately address the real complexity and diversity of the learning problems of students' with mild disabilities, this research also developed an adaptive case recommendation approach which identifies the most suitable authentic learning cases based on the characteristics of learners (teachers), the strengths, weaknesses, and types of disabilities of their students, the teaching problems of various mathematical topics, and the teaching context in order to facilitate adaptive case-based learning in the context of problem-based e-learning for regular and special education teachers' knowledge development. Clustering and information retrieval techniques were used to construct the context and content maps for case-based reasoning with the capability of semantics identification. The adaptive recommendation approach not only enables the realization of adaptive problem-based e-learning, but also enhances teachers' practical knowledge and assists them to solve students' learning problems.

Learning disabilities like dyslexia, dysgraphia or dyscalculia are either not understood or ignored in schools. As a result, the schoolchildren suffer for no fault of theirs and they lag behind in their course of learning. They may find it difficult to achieve the basic skills of learning such as reading, writing, reasoning or doing arithmetic calculations. Dyscalculia, a learning disorder in which a student faces severe difficulties in mathematical computations, includes all types of difficulties in learning mathematics ranging from inability in understanding numbers to inability in applying mathematical principles to solve problems. Since understanding and working with numbers require mental skills, children who have trouble in visualizing concepts struggle with computation. A number of learning styles can be incorporated for the dyscalculic children who face severe problems. Visual learning is a learning style which involves learning through seeing things. It involves the use of charts, graphs, pictures, diagrams, videos, transparencies, flipcharts, hand-outs etc in the learning process. Activities in practical Mathematics help students immensely in visualization. Innovative use of technology may help dyscalculic learners to overcome their disability to a large extent. Technology can greatly aid the process of mathematical exploration and clever use of such technology can help engage such students with learning disorders. As mathematics learning requires visual patterns to fully grasp the number concepts or computations, it is very essential for the schools to adopt visual learning strategies to meet the needs of dyscalculic learners."

The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the effects of calculators on the problem-solving abilities and anxiety levels of 3 groups of middle school students, those with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a control group. The overarching research question asks what effects calculators have on these 3 groups. A 2-by-3 factorial ANOVA was conducted to explore the main effects or interactions between the use of calculators, disability, and problem-solving skills on the 2 math subtests of the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement Second Edition (KTEA-II). A 2nd ANOVA was performed to examine the main effects or interactions between the use of calculators, disability, and anxiety according to the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale. Finally, a Pearson Correlation examined possible correlations between computational and problem-solving abilities. Students with learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrated lower problem-solving skills and higher anxiety than typical peers. Calculators did not show a significant impact on students’ anxiety or problem-solving skills, nor was there a significant interaction between the use of a calculator and the disability status. Further study with different tests is recommended due to the exceptional construct validity of the KTEA-II. This study contributes to social change by informing teaching professionals and parents that caution should be taken when assigning the use of a calculator as an accommodation to students with learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as calculators could actually cause anxiety levels to increase.

In order to graduate with a regular diploma, all students must take and pass three high school mathematics courses including algebra I. Students with high functioning autism or Asperger’s syndrome present with a unique set of cognitive deficits that may prevent achievement in the mathematics curriculum, even though they present with average mathematical skills. The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of a modified learning strategy to increase the mathematical word problem solving ability of children with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome; determine if the use of ""Solve It!"" increases the self-perceptions of mathematical ability, attitudes towards mathematics and attitudes towards solving mathematical word problems; and, determine if ""Solve It!"" cue cards or a ""Solve It!"" multimedia academic story works best as a prime to increase the percentage correct if the student does not maintain use of the strategy. The subjects were recruited from a central Florida school district. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was confirmed by a review of records and the completion of the Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 2005). Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001) subtest scores for reading comprehension and mathematical computation were completed to identify the current level of functioning. The Mathematical Problem Solving Assessment-Short Form (Montague, 1996) was administered to determine the need for word problem solving intervention. The subjects were then taught a mathematical word problem solving strategy called ""Solve It!,"" during non-content course time at their schools. Generalization data were collected in each subject's regular education mathematics classroom. Sessions were video-taped, work samples were scored, and then graphed using a multiple baseline format. Three weeks after the completion of the study, maintenance data were collected. If subjects did not maintain a high use of the strategy, they were entered into the second study to determine if a video prime or written prime served best to increase word problem solving. The results of the study indicate a functional relationship between the use of the ""Solve It!"" strategy and the percentage correct on curriculum based mathematical word problems. The subjects obtained efficient use of strategy use in five training sessions and applied the strategy successfully for five acquisition sessions. Percentage correct on mathematical word problems ranged from 20% during baseline to 100% during training and acquisition trials. Error analysis indicated reading comprehension interference and probable executive functioning interference. Students who did not maintain strategy use quickly returned to intervention level using a prime. Both primes, cue cards and multimedia academic story, increased performance back to intervention levels for two students. However, one prime, the multimedia academic story and not the cue cards, increased performance back to intervention levels for one student. "

These then get converted into electronic formats, so that they can be embedded in a document and/or displayed in an editor or web browser. This process can be used for preparing teaching material, assignments, or entering mathematical content for online tests. Our system does not require the user to have extensive knowledge of the syntax of any markup language or mathematical document specification language, so that learning to use it should be relatively straightforward for non-specialists.

",2010,Software for math and science education for the deaf,Persons With Hearing Impairments*.//Software*.//Mathematics/*education.//Science/*education.//Child.//Female.//Humans.//Male.//Software Design.//User-Computer Interface,"In this article, we describe the development of two novel approaches to teaching math and science concepts to deaf children using three-dimensional animated interactive software. One approach, Mathsigner, is non-immersive and the other, SMILE, is a virtual reality immersive environment. The content is curriculum-based, and the animated signing characters are constructed with state-of-the art technology and design. We report preliminary development findings of usability and appeal based on programme features (e.g. 2D/three-dimensional, immersiveness, interaction type, avatar and interface design) and subject features (hearing status, gender and age). Programme features of 2D/three-dimensional, immersiveness and interaction type were very much affected by subject features. Among subject features, we find significant effects of hearing status (deaf children take longer time and make more mistakes than hearing children) and gender (girls take longer than boys; girls prefer immersive environments rather than desktop presentation; girls are more interested in content than technology compared to boys). For avatar type, we found a preference for seamless, deformable characters over segmented ones. For interface comparisons, there were no subject effects, but an animated interface resulted in reduced time to task completion compared to static interfaces with and without sound and highlighting. These findings identify numerous features that affect software design and appeal and suggest that designers must be careful in their assumptions during programme development."

In one condition, students learned how to compute with fractions on an as-needed basis while they worked to solve the Enhanced anchored Instruction problems. In the other condition, teachers used a computer-based instructional module in place of one of the Enhanced anchored Instruction problems to deliver formal fraction instruction. The results indicated that students in both instructional formats improved their fraction computational skills and that formal instruction provided an added benefit. Both instructional conditions improved students' problem-solving skills by about the same amount. The findings suggest that combining formal fraction instruction with Enhanced anchored Instruction is a viable way to improve the problem-solving and computational skills of students with learning disabilities in math.

The two test administration accommodations were resource guides and calculators. A stratified random sample of schools was selected to represent the demographic characteristics of the state. The sample included both students with and without disabilities. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three possible administration conditions: resource guides, calculators, or standard administration. A repeated-measures design (pretest and posttest) was used to examine the effects of the accommodations. Students in the participating schools took the operational version of the statewide assessment in grades 3 and 6 in the spring of 2005, and then were retested in grades 4 (N = 947) and 7 (N = 997) with the same form of the test under one of the three administration conditions in the spring of 2006. The results of this study suggest that the use of resource guides were not effective. The results for the use of calculators as a test administration accommodation were somewhat mixed with both small positive and small negative effects sizes varying by grade. Exploratory analyses on subgroups of students with various disabilities suggest that there may be small positive benefits for some students in some disability categories under some accommodated conditions.

A multiple baseline across subjects design was utilized to examine four dependent variables: completion of spelling homework, accuracy of spelling homework, completion of math homework, accuracy of math homework. Data were collected and analyzed during baseline, three phases of intervention, and maintenance. Throughout baseline and all phases, participants followed typical classroom procedures, brought their homework to school each day and gave it to the general education teacher. During Phase I of the intervention, participants self-monitored with a daily sheet at home and on the computer at school in the morning using KidTools (Fitzgerald & Koury, 2003); a student friendly, self-monitoring program. They also participated in brief daily conferences to review their self-monitoring sheets with the investigator, their special education teacher. Phase II followed the same steps except conferencing was reduced to two days a week, which were randomly selected by the researcher and Phase III conferencing was one random day a week. Maintenance data were taken over a two-to-three week period subsequent to the end of the intervention. Results of this study demonstrated self-monitoring substantially improved spelling and math homework completion and accuracy rates of students with disabilities in an inclusive, general education classroom. On average, completion and accuracy rates were highest over baseline in Phase III. self-monitoring led to higher percentages of completion and accuracy during each phase of the intervention compared to baseline, group percentages also rose slightly during maintenance. Therefore, results suggest self-monitoring leads to short-term maintenance in spelling and math homework completion and accuracy. This study adds to the existing literature by investigating the effects of self-monitoring of homework for students with disabilities included in general education classrooms. Future research should consider selecting participants with other demographic characteristics, using peers for conferencing instead of the teacher, and the use of self-monitoring with other academic subjects (e.g., science, history). Additionally, future research could investigate the effects of each of the two self-monitoring components used alone, with or without the conferencing. "

Computer-supported instruction has a very important role to play as an advanced technological instruction as it employs different instructional techniques like powerpoint presentations, video presentations etc. The use of computers in the classroom encourages active learning and meets the diverse needs of the learners through the use of technology in education. Dyscalculia is a learning disorder in which pupils face severe difficulties in performing mathematical computations. Innovative use of computer technology may help dyscalculics to overcome their disability to a large extent. Research studies (Lugo, 2004; Mohankumar & Rajaguru, 2001; Calhoon, 1999; Nwaizu & Ifeanyi, 1990) reveal how multimedia computer technology could be effectively used as a potential supplemental teaching aid rather than traditional classroom instruction. The present investigation examined the effectiveness of using computers for teaching mathematics to dyscalculic children. The Pre-test Post-test Equivalent Group Experimental Design was followed for conducting the study. The sample comprised of 20 dyscalculic students at the primary level each for the experimental group and the control group. The tool used was an achievement test in mathematics prepared by the investigators. ""t"" test for independent group was employed for the analysis of data.

This study explores the origin of these qualitative differences through a detailed analysis of one student with an mathematical learning disabilities. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of weekly videotaped tutoring sessions during the student's eighth through twelfth grade years. An error analysis was conducted on the student's responses to a computerized multiplication fact program (Math Master), which confirmed that she demonstrated a similar error profile to that documented in students with mathematical learning disabilitiess. A microgenetic analysis of a subset of tutoring sessions (19 sessions total) focused on the student's math fact usage while she was engaged in more complex problem solving, specifically fraction reduction. Although her math fact errors appear on the surface to be unrelated, the detailed analysis revealed the origin of these errors to be her atypical and cognitively cumbersome strategy for solving multiplication problems. An intervention, which functioned to decrease the cognitive load of her multiplication strategy, increased her accuracy on fraction reduction problems. This research suggests that a detailed analyses of students' problem solving can reveal the origins of the qualitative differences that typify mathematical learning disabilities, and provide information that can contribute to strategies for remediation.

Unfortunately, many of these students struggle to achieve at a level commensurate with their peers. As a result, few students with disabilities pursue advanced scientific coursework or enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. Technology offers promise as a means to promote these students' academic achievement and attitudes toward science. However, there is limited research that utilizes the quality standards identified by Gersten and Edyburn (2007) that examine how this can be accomplished. This article presents a review of literature (N = 71) from 1997-2009 across the often disparate fields of special education, science, and technology using the Universal Design for Learning (Rose, Meyer, & Hitchcock, 2005) and Cognitive Load (Sweller, 1999) theoretical frameworks. It concludes with the identification of key research issues that should be considered when examining how technology can affect the academic achievement and attitudes of students with learning and other disabilities in inclusive science classrooms.

Some researchers say it improves and motivates student achievement. Some researchers say it has no effect on learning. Alarmingly, the data on eighth grade performance in math is low across the United States. In the state of Georgia there are gaps in the performance of subgroups of students in math. No Child Left Behind (NCLB) mandates that educational leaders provide opportunities for teachers to integrate technology in the classroom. Little is known about the effects of SuccessMaker™, a computer based instruction, on NCLB subgroups in eighth grade. The purpose of this study was to see the effectiveness of SuccessMaker™ on selected NCLB subgroups as implemented by principals. A sample of 500 eighth grade students from four Title I schools were participants in this study. Schools A and B (N = 250) implemented SuccessMaker™ for three years as a supplement to the math instruction received in the classroom. Schools B and C (N = 250) used no computer based instruction to supplement math instruction. Four 2 x 2 ANOVAs were used to analyze the 2009 Criterion Referenced Competency Test math scores. The results of the ANOVA, indicated that there was a main effect on ethnicity (p = .00) and disability (p = .01) status. There was no interaction between instructional strategy and subgroups. The implications of the findings is that implementation of computer based (assisted) instruction is key to the success of a program. Future research on SuccessMaker™ is necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached regarding the effective on student performance in math as measured by the CRCT. "

The project aims to reveal the mathematical potential of students in special education. The focus is on a topic that is generally recognised as rather difficult for weak students: subtraction up to 100 with crossing the ten. The students involved in the project were 8-12 years old. Their mathematical level was one to four years behind the level of their peer group in regular schools. In special education, teachers often use standardised written tests to assess their students' mathematical understanding and computational skills. These tests do not allow students to use auxiliary resources. In the research project, an assessment instrument was developed and used in which items taken from a standardised written test were placed in an information and communication technology environment. The digitised items were enriched with an optional auxiliary tool that students could use for solving the problems. Currently, two sub-studies, investigating two different auxiliary tools for the same set of subtraction problems, have been completed. In the first study (n = 37), the tool provided students with digital manipulatives. In the second study (n = 43), an empty number line was included in the information and communication technology environment. In both studies the students' scores in the information and communication technology version of the test items were compared with the standardised written version of the test items. The results of both sub-studies show that the students could benefit from using an auxiliary tool. Consequently, the information and communication technology-based dynamic assessment could help to reveal weak students' potential in subtraction. In addition, the studies disclosed that in the manipulatives study there was a clear preference for direct subtraction procedures (taking away), whereas in the number line study indirect addition or subtraction procedures (e. g. adding on) were frequently used as well."

If they have concurrent physical impairments, they may have difficulty accessing educational materials, especially when manipulation of items is used to enhance learning. This study consisted of three case studies with children who used their own speech generating device to control a Lego robot to do math measurement lessons. System use was examined by measuring participant performance in math measurement lessons, describing the process of using the system, and contrasting system use with other methods of accomplishing math measurement activities. The study informed the underlying theories driving the study: that being able to do hands-on activities in learning is beneficial, that integration of Augmentative and Alternative Communication and manipulation in educational activities is important, and that assistive robots can bridge the functional gap between participant abilities and activity requirements. The teacher measured participants’ procedural knowledge based on how they manipulated items using the robot. She measured participants’ conceptual understanding, use of appropriate language, and explanation of reasoning based on their communication. The participants used speech generating device output, non-verbal communication and the robot to communicate. The study showed that manipulation and communication can be interrelated and that having access to both enhanced the participants’ message. Using the robot as a tool in these math lessons had some limitations, but they were easily compensated for by the teacher. The efficiency of using the robot to accomplish tasks was lower than observing the teacher, but there were benefits in terms of effectiveness and participant satisfaction. Stakeholders felt that using the robot was a more effective way for participants to 'show what they know' than observing the teacher and guiding her based on her questions. Using the robot also had some perceived benefits in terms of effectiveness as a learning tool with regards to motivation, engagement, and hands-on experience. In general, participants were more satisfied using the robot than watching the teacher do the math activities. However, improving robot task efficiency would further improve user satisfaction and this challenge will be addressed in future studies. "

This framework provides mechanisms to search and match similar learning cases according to encountered teaching problems by information retrieval techniques and to develop an adaptive learning case by adaptation techniques. Adaptation techniques include a substitution technique, a removal technique, and a composition technique, and utilize cosine-measure and genetic algorithm. In this research, adaptive learning cases were developed for teaching students with mild disabilities so as to assist regular and special education teachers to develop practical knowledge of teaching more effectively.

Sixteen children with Developmental dyscalculia aged 8-10 years and 16 matched control children completed the 5-week computer training. All children played the game 15 min a day for 5 days a week. The efficiency of the training was evaluated by means of neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a number line task. In general, children with and without Developmental dyscalculia showed a benefit from the training indicated by (a) improved spatial representation of numbers and (b) the number of correctly solved arithmetical problems. Regarding group differences in brain activation, children with Developmental dyscalculia showed less activation in bilateral parietal regions, which reflects neuronal dysfunction in pivotal regions for number processing. Both groups showed reduced recruitment of relevant brain regions for number processing after the training which can be attributed to automatization of cognitive processes necessary for mathematical reasoning. Moreover, results point to a partial remediation of deficient brain activation in dyscalculics after consolidation of acquired and refined number representation. To conclude, the present study represents the first attempt to evaluate a custom-designed training program in a group of dyscalculic children and results indicate that the training leads to an improved spatial representation of the mental number line and a modulation of neural activation, which both facilitate processing of numerical tasks.

This study investigated the differential effects of computer-mediated-SBI compared to teacher-mediated schema-based instruction on mathematics word problem solving performance of mathematically low-achieving third-grade students using two commercially available packages (i.e., GO Solve Word Problems computer software [Tom Snyder Productions, 2005] and ""Solving Math Word Problems: Teaching Students with Learning Disabilities Using Schema-Based Instruction"" [Pro-Ed, 2007]). In addition, teacher and student satisfaction with strategy instruction and program materials were examined. Twenty-five students from one school district were randomly assigned to either a computer-mediated condition or a teacher-mediated condition. Both conditions employed schema-based instruction that guided students to identify the problem type, and map the problem features using diagrams. Further, both conditions employed key instructional design principles and mathematics problem solving instructional features identified in the literature as effective for teaching students with disabilities (e.g., schematic diagrams, worked examples, visual representations, modeling). Intervention in both conditions consisted of 15 instructional sessions spanning six school weeks and session times remained constant between conditions. A pretest-posttest-delayed posttest repeated measures design (2 Group x 3 Times) with random assignment evaluates word problem solving gains of the two conditions using criterion-referenced word problem solving pretest, posttest and maintenance tests. Overall, results indicated that students in both conditions made significant gains in word problem solving performance and maintained gains after four weeks with no significant differences between conditions. Results suggest that schema-based instruction was effective at increasing and maintaining student skills in word problem solving performance regardless of instructional mode. Results also revealed no significant difference between conditions on student satisfaction or motivation and the teachers' preference for the teacher-mediated curriculum over the computer software was indicated. Results suggest that the most important variable in terms of student gains in word problem solving acquisition and maintenance for mathematically low-performing students in computer-mediated settings is the strategy implemented (e.g., schema-based instruction that employs key instructional design features). Implications, limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed. "

While prior research on mathematical learning disabilities has classified students on the basis of test scores and documented performance differences between groups, this dissertation focuses on the qualitative differences in individual students with mathematical learning disabilities as each student attempted to learn. This study extends the understanding of mathematical learning disabilities by (1) focusing on the mathematical domain of fractions, (2) selecting for study students whose difficulties with mathematics are clearly due to an mathematical learning disability and not other factors, (3) conducting detailed diagnostic analyses of video-taped tutoring sessions, and (4) contrasting the difficulties that the students with mathematical learning disabilities experience to data collected with five typically achieving fifth grade control students. The two case study students, ""Lisa"" (19-year-old community college student) and ""Emily"" (18-year-old high school student) each participated in a pretest, four weekly tutoring sessions, and a posttest focused on fraction concepts. Achievement test scores, interviews, and videotaped tutoring session data were used to establish that Lisa and Emily met classic mathematical learning disability qualifications, and more stringent response-to-intervention criteria. Both students demonstrated unexplained persistent low math achievement and neither student benefited from a tutoring protocol that had been effective for typically achieving fifth grade students. The tutoring sessions were analyzed using microgenetic methods. Analysis indicated that each student relied upon a unique collection of atypical understandings, which reoccurred across the sessions, were resistant to standard instructional approaches, and proved to be highly consequential for the student's ability to understand more complex fraction concepts. A cross case analysis revealed surprising similarities in the atypical understandings displayed by both case study students. These atypical understandings stemmed from and contributed to the student's inability to conceptualize and manipulate representations of fractional quantity. These atypical understandings were not similarly problematic for the fifth grade control students, but did appear in one additional student with an mathematical learning disability. This suggests that there are qualitative differences in the difficulties experienced by students with mathematical learning disabilities and that it may be possible to design screening measures to identify these indicators of atypicality. In addition, remediation approaches should take into account and specifically target these atypicalities. "

",2011,An investigation of the relationships between educational technology and mathematics achievement of students with learning disabilities,educational technology.//mathematics achievement.//learning disabilities students.//Educational Programs.//Learning Disabilities.//Students.//Technology.//Grounded Theory.//Mathematics,"Educators are continually looking for ways to use technology that will help students who struggle with mathematics, especially students with learning disabilities. There is limited research on the effects of instructional technology resources on the achievement of students with learning disabilities in the state selected for this study. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of instructional technology resources on the mathematics achievement of students with learning disabilities. This study used a mixed-method triangulation concurrent design. In the quantitative portion of the study, the independent variable was 8th grade AMRT math scores in 67 school districts in the state selected for this study. The dependent variables were students per computer, internet access per students and teachers level of certification. The qualitative portion of the study involved interviews with twelve teachers across the state selected for the study. Teachers were asked four questions that covered implementing technology in the classroom, educational technology and student achievement, technology skill level, and financial issues. Grounded theory analysis was used to interpret qualitative interviews for the purpose of discovering and labeling variables. Emerging categories and sub-categories were analyzed. The quantitative date was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. This statistical model was chosen because this research is concerned with relationships between three independent variables and a dependent variable. Results were mixed. School districts with lower ratios of students to computer and Internet access per students did not outperform districts with higher ratios (Beta= .064, p>.05). Districts with a higher percentage of teachers with advanced certification did outperform districts with a lower percentage of teachers with advanced certification (Beta= .289, p<.05). Teachers’ interviews revealed a number of themes. Teachers believe that instructional technology is improving achievement of students with learning disabilities in mathematics. Teachers also believe that technology should be used to reach students’ individual learning styles and technology should be used daily for instruction. All teachers interviewed reported that students are motivated by the use of modern technology. Most teachers believe they have the necessary skills to implement technology and the resources are available for them to do so. "

Might it be possible that their difficulties are mainly restricted to some fields, such as numeracy and mental computation, but do not encompass the entire domain of mathematics? Is the use of a calculator recommended? Is non-elementary mathematics accessible at most for the brightest students with Down's syndrome? Our experience with about 30 students with Down's syndrome, attending Italian mainstream secondary schools, is that these students can solve mathematical problems, using simple algebraic equations, though they may have very poor numeracy skills and need to use the calculator even with the simplest computations. Moreover, a familiarity with more advanced topics, as algebraic computation and analytic geometry, can help to raise their self-esteem and improve their numeracy too. Surprisingly, these students can learn and apply mathematical procedures in a variety of other different contexts. For instance, Francesca, an Italian student attending a secondary mainstream school, with a mild impairment in numeracy and relatively good linguistic skills, started with algebra and then learned to solve problems in the areas of nutritional science and of business administration. In the same way, Martina, a student in a mainstream secondary school with severe linguistic and numerical impairments, learned to work with Cartesian coordinates and formulas in analytic geometry. She began connecting points on a Cartesian plane, given their coordinates, and colouring in the shapes, such as flowers and animals, that they define. Applying the two points distance formula and verifying the result, she learned to measure the distance of two points with a ruler and to understand the concept of ""millimetres"". The role of the inclusion in mainstream Italian schools of every disabled student, regardless the severity of the disability, has been crucial for these results. "

DIF analyses detected performance differences between examinees without accommodations and those who used a calculator or those where the item presentation was altered. Latent performance class analyses revealed that performance differences were associated with item difficulty and abilty in addition to accommodation status. Results support validity studies that use mixture models that can consider context variables related to item type, academic skills, and accommodations.  "

Moreover, thematic analysis of the teachers' interviews provided a further dimension for understanding factors influencing the information and communication technology integration process. These results further confirmed the positive impact of computer skills training on the students' learning experience which also revealed a strong belief in the right of every child to all learning opportunities, particularly information and communication technology regardless of his/her abilities.

Middle school special education teachers in two states were surveyed. Three main results were found: (a) relatively little technology is reported being used to teach mathematics to this population, (b) teachers generally perceived the technology for mathematics to be effective, and (C) teachers reported not being effectively prepared to teach with technology and felt knowledge and training served as both a barrier and a support to its implementation.

One advantage of computer-based instruction includes allowing the user to tailor instruction to their particular style of learning (Slavin & Lake, 2009). An essential part of individualizing computer-based instruction involves the students use of active electronic support tools, which may promote mathematical metacognition in the process of understanding mathematical concepts. This study included 19 sixth grade students who attended a school for students with learning disabilities and analyzes their use of active electronic support tools (e.g. hyperlinks, calculator) during their engagement in computer-based instruction. Specifically, students completed grade-level lessons in the Math Learning Companion (Freeman, 2010), an online supplemental mathematics curriculum developed for students in the later elementary and early secondary grades. The relationships between students use of active electronic support tools, gains between the pre and posttest, and achievement as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson Broad Math score and the Wechsler IQ scales were explored. A cross-case analysis was conducted on four students to provide insight into how they tailored the program to meet their individual needs. Findings indicate that students are using the active electronic support tools to individualize the program with the intent of maximizing their understanding of mathematical concepts. "

We examined whether participants with fragile X syndrome would display emergent fraction–decimal relations following brief, intensive match-to-sample training on baseline relations. The performance profiles on tests of symmetry and transitivity/equivalence of 11 participants with fragile X syndrome, aged 10–23 years, following baseline match-to-sample training were compared to those of 11 age- and IQ-matched controls with idiopathic developmental disability. The results showed that both groups of participants showed significant improvements in the baseline (trained) relations, as expected. However, participants with fragile X syndrome failed to show significant improvements in the (untrained) symmetry and transitivity/equivalence relations compared to those in the control group. A categorical analysis of the data indicated that five participants with fragile X syndrome and eight controls showed at least 'intermediate' emergence of symmetry relations, whereas one individual with fragile X syndrome and three controls showed at least intermediate emergence of transitivity/equivalence relations. A correlation analysis of the data indicated that improvements in the symmetry relations were significantly associated with improvements in the transitivity/equivalence relations in the control group (r =.69, p =.018), but this was not the case in the fragile X syndrome group (r =.34, p >.05). Participant IQ was significantly associated with improvements in the symmetry relations in individuals with fragile X syndrome (r =.60, p =.049), but not in controls (r =.21, p >.05). Taken together, these results suggest that brief, computerized match-to-sample training may produce emergent mathematical relations for a subset of children with fragile X syndrome and developmental disabilities. However, the ability of individuals with fragile X syndrome to form transitivity/equivalence relations may be impaired relative to those with idiopathic developmental disabilities, which may be attributed to neurodevelopmental variables associated with the syndrome.

Fifty-six students (8- to 12-year-olds), with a mathematical level of end grade 2, participated in the study. They were given a computer-based test on subtraction with different types of problems. Although most students had not been taught indirect addition for solving subtraction problems, they frequently applied this procedure spontaneously. The item characteristics were the main prompt for using indirect addition. Context problems that reflect an adding-on situation and problems that have a small difference between the minuend and subtrahend most strongly elicited the use of the indirect addition procedure. Moreover, indirect addition was identified as a highly successful procedure for special education students, and the best predictor of a correct answer was found in combination with a stringing strategy.

These difficulties limit students’ abilities to solve everyday math problems and develop the skills necessary for higher level mathematics. Prior research on problem solving indicates that direct instruction on problem schemas can improve problem solving performance. Previous research also suggests that instruction using the concrete-representational-abstract sequence and instruction with virtual manipulatives can enhance understanding of mathematical concepts. However, a concrete-representational-abstract sequence that incorporates virtual manipulatives has not been combined with schema-based instruction to help students solve word problems with fractions. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using an intervention that combined the concrete-representational-abstract sequence with virtual manipulatives and schema-based instruction to improve the problem solving performance of students with learning disabilities or learning problems in mathematics on word problems with fractions. This sequence of instruction was combined with a mnemonic strategy called the LISTS strategy to help students remember the steps in the problem solving sequence. Using a single-case multiple baseline across participants design, the researcher provided an intervention to five students in the fifth grade that included instruction in three problem schemas for addition and subtraction (change, compare, and group). Results indicated that all students made some gains in performance on problems similar to those presented during the intervention, but the three students who were able to make connections between problem schemas and equations demonstrated significant gains in performance. The concrete models and virtual models used in the concrete-representational-abstract sequence enhanced understanding of fraction word problems for some, but not all, students. Additionally, analysis of student performance on pre- and post-tests of problems with novel features indicated that students made only small gains in performance on fraction word problems that included difficult vocabulary, irrelevant information, or information that required different conceptualizations than those presented during the intervention.

Using a qualitative approach, this study explored the current system used by students with visual impairments to access algebra and the impact of a supported eText player (ReadHear™) on their access to and understanding of algebraic expressions. The findings suggested that students were successful with using the technology to access and understand algebraic expressions. The findings also indicated that efficiency and individualization were key aspects to students' use of and appreciation for the tool, which differs from students' traditional means of accessing mathematics. Additional research is needed to understand how supported eText compares to traditional methods that students with visual impairments use to access text and how this technology can be used in the mathematics classroom.

We used a multiple-baseline-across-participants design to investigate the effects of video self-modeling on the mathematics skill acquisition of adolescents with autism. Four adolescent male students viewed videos of themselves on an iPad solving mathematical problems to estimate the amount of money used to pay for a given item and the amount to receive in change. Findings support a functional relationship between video self-modeling and performance on math skills for each participant. Subsequently, the video self-modeling was systematically faded during maintenance sessions, with little deterioration of skill. Follow-up data probes were interpreted to conclude that student characteristics may affect retention of skill. Implications for practice and research are discussed."

Cogmed RM, a computerized intervention, uses adaptive training over 25 sessions and has shown efficacy in improving working memory in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a variety of other conditions. Research on Cogmed has been done in clinical settings in Europe and the United Kingdom; however, little research has been conducted in the United States. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the efficacy of the Cogmed program in improving working memory and academic achievement for children with learning disabilities in the United States. Baddeley's multi-component model of working memory served as the theoretical basis for the study. Participants were 12 children, aged 10 to 14, from a rural school district in Texas; their scores were compared on pretest and posttest measures of verbal short-term memory, visual-spatial short-term memory, executive working memory, reading achievement, and math achievement. Training with Cogmed significantly improved verbal short-term memory, visual-spatial short-term memory and executive working memory but had no effect on reading achievement or math achievement when measured 3 weeks post-intervention. These findings may inform the efforts of those who work with students with learning disabilities, specifically, in their efforts to help students with learning disabilities in their potential for improved academic achievement, increased self-esteem, higher graduation rates, and increased access to post-secondary options. Future research is needed to examine the long-term effects of adaptive training as a school-based intervention to remediate or prevent learning problems in children, giving them a better chance at successful academic outcomes.

Throughout baseline and intervention, participants were assigned daily homework. During intervention, participants self-monitored in the evening at home and in the morning on the computer at school, and took part in a brief scripted, daily conference with the special education teacher to review the self-monitoring sheets. During the last two intervention phases, the conference was reduced to two and then one randomly selected day(s) per week, respectively. Maintenance data were taken over a 2-3-week period after the removal of the intervention. The self-monitoring package led to higher percentages of both math and spelling homework completion and accuracy during each phase of the intervention compared to baseline. These improved performances were maintained. "

Specifically, it describes the teacher's perceptions and use of e-portfolio assessment, and its relationships to curricular content, as well as how the relationships among e-portfolio assessment, curricular content, and instruction varied for students with and without IEPs. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, participant and passive observation, document/artifacts analysis, and field notes. Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Coding was used in the final analyses. The results reveal e-portfolio assessment was defined by the fusion of its purpose, creation, selection of activities, and ongoing development. Overall, e-portfolio assessment benefited the teacher and his students. Students' e-portfolio entries helped the teacher identify conceptual understandings and errors, respond by re-teaching or clarification, and reflect on the efficacy of his instruction. E-portfolios also enhanced students' motivation, provided students with a more flexible work environment, and allowed students to easily edit their reflections as they grasped clarified concepts. Students with IEPs needed additional support in editing and learning the concepts being taught. Barriers related to using e-portfolio assessment were teacher time, computer accessibility, digitalization, and situational factors. The meaning of the results and the implications for practice and future research are discussed. "

These laws require schools to provide interventions for struggling learners, as part of the Response to Intervention process (IDEA, 2004). Accelerated Math (AM), published by Renaissance Learning, is a scientifically based program designed to supplement quality instruction as part of the Response to Intervention process. This correlational study examined ex post facto data using pre and posttest scores on the STAR Math Test in relation to amount of classroom time dedicated to AM instruction This computer-based program was examined as part of the existing school day, in public school systems in the rural Arkansas area. The results of the study showed a strong correlation between the amount of time and student performance and a decrease in the achievement gap when AM is implemented. Some concerns were noted about lower student gains in older grades and lack of participation in younger grades. Several reasons were explored for this issue, including teacher evaluation, math anxiety, and stereotypes. Findings from the study may help streamline instructional strategies and processes, and improve teacher effectiveness and evaluation procedures for mathematics instruction of all students. "

The study compared the performance of students in the learning disabilities self-contained classrooms before and after the implementation of the Interactive Whiteboard. The research was conducted within a rural school district in South Carolina. The participants included 5th grade students that have learning disabilities, are taught in self-contained classrooms, and are eligible to participate in the standardized testing. The researcher collected qualitative data to include demographical, student information, and summative, English Language Arts and mathematics PASS scores. The principal, convergent theme within American educational settings is the improvement of educational quality and the subsequent learning of children (U.S. Department of Education, 2012). Since 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has mandated rigorous, evidence-based educational practices for levels of K-12 education. However, these two focal points (quality and learning) have led to political and social debate as to their definition and conceptual ideology. This holds particularly true as interpretations of the term 'quality' and its relative meaning to each level of education and the demographical and learning styles and difficulties of children. Technology has now become more and more the medium in which teachers attempt to level the playing. field of ever increasing accountability and diminishing and/or limited resources (Leonard, Noh and Orey, 2007). The SAS 9.1 software was used to calculate descriptive statics involving mean, median, and standard deviation for the dependent variable (standardized test scores) to generate a statistical descriptive analysis. An independent t-test and an analysis of variance (AVONA) were also used to test the six hypotheses to determine if statistical differences exist. The independent t-tests were utilized to compare cohorts before and after implementation of the Interactive Whiteboard to determine if mean scores in the given areas were significantly different. ANOVAs (analysis of variance) examined the impacts of Interactive Whiteboard usage to determine if significant differences in summative assessment results of the performance of students with disabilities between and within cohorts based upon gender and racial ethnicity indicators. The results of the study indicated that the Interactive Whiteboard is an effective tool in enhancing the learning of Learning Disabled self-contained student. Results from independent t-tests yielded significant differences in academic performance when comparing English Language Arts and Mathematics PASS examination scores of students who were assessed after Interactive Whiteboard implementation to those before to implementation.

However, what type of math instruction will most effectively raise student achievement for students with disabilities (students with disabilities) remains a matter of debate. Problem-based learning is a promising methodology for engaging and motivating students' learning while increasing their math skills. Enhanced anchored Instruction is a form of problem-based learning, rooted in a constructivist framework, which guides students through complex problems through video anchors and context rich environments that has been shown to significantly improve math performance of students with disabilities. Assessing student performance during Problem-based learning units is often difficult. Formative assessments supplement curriculum by allowing teachers to gather information and assess student learning during the course of instruction. However, despite the rise in formative assessment use, the effects of formative assessment in Problem-based learning curricula are rarely addressed. This study examined the effect of embedding formative assessments in the Enhanced anchored Instruction curriculum on academic outcomes in middle school math classrooms. Results showed that problem solving performance did not improve with the addition of formative assessment and gains on computation performance were mixed. "

This study describes a computer game for training Approximate Number System, which can improve appropriate math abilities. We hypothesize that the daily use of this game by children at risk for Specific Learning Disabilities with Math, together with other types of interventions directed at memory or visual-spatial orientation, will help improve their Approximate Number System, their ability to manipulate symbolic and non-symbolic quantities and finally their math performances.

J.",2014,Initial Experiences Using Vibratory Touchscreens to Display Graphical Math Concepts to Students with Visual Impairments,Mathematics education.//Students with disabilities.//Touch screens.//Vision disorders.//Open source software,"This article presents initial experiences using vibratory touchscreens and audible sounds to communicate graphical concepts in mathematics education to students with visual impairments. These studies are motivated by the prospect of displaying graphical and mathematical concepts typically taught in a highly visual manner through nonvisual channels. First, a touchscreen-based teaching paradigm for math education of individuals with visual impairments is introduced and hardware and software employing commercially available and open source components are presented. Then, pilot studies on user comprehension of grids and points--graphical entities students encounter early in K-12 mathematics education and that can serve as building blocks for more complex lessons--are presented. These studies, conducted with students with visual impairments, explore perception of objects through haptic feedback alone, auditory feedback alone, and combinations of the two. The results show that each student could successfully find and locate 100% of displayed points on a grid. These results, complemented with the positive qualitative feedback received from students and their teachers, suggest that vibratory touchscreens have the potential to be beneficial in the classroom for conveying graphical math concepts.

The Federal Government guidelines mandate inclusion of all students into the public school facilities. All school age children in the United States are afforded the same opportunities for public education. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of Computer-Aided Instruction as a treatment for teaching mathematics to a group of autistic pupils in an elementary school environment. The public later elementary school is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan and had a student enrollment of 488 in grades 3-5 for the 2011-2012 school year (MDE; http://michigan.gov/mde, February 12, 2014). Questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teachers and itinerant staff, including social workers, psychologists and speech and language therapists. Data were gathered using tests developed by teachers and designed to meet state guidelines. Data analysis involved comparing the test scores of autism spectrum disorder pupils taught by Computer-Aided Instruction to those for pupils taught using conventional teacher-led instruction. The computer-based treatment (TeachTown® software) was compared to the traditional treatment of teacher-led instruction using data from pre- and post-testing as well as observation, and was shown to improve both pupil attentiveness (time on task) as well as math test scores. As schools, educators, staff and parents continue to wrestle with the adverse effects of increased numbers of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder pupils and decreased dollars dedicated to their human teachers, an option seems to lie in the use of Computer-Aided Instruction software and the focusing of resources in matching pupils to computers. It is recommended that school administration evaluate the cost of Computer-Aided Instruction and training as an option to monies appropriated to adding more teachers and teacher human aides. It is also recommended that more research be conducted to evaluate the use of Computer-Aided Instruction software with autism spectrum disorder pupils of larger population size and different socio-economic environments."

The mean number of errors was calculated, and we examined whether there was a significant difference in the level of accuracy based on National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) certification or job role of participants. Methods: The authors selected five work sheets representative of mathematics materials transcribed for K-12 students. After completing an online demographic survey, participants prepared at least one of the worksheets and completed an online transcription survey about how they prepared each worksheet. Results: The majority of the 59 participants spent less than 30 minutes transcribing each worksheet, and the predominant method for production was the use of braille translation software. Overall, participants had a high level of accuracy on the literary braille portions of the worksheets. There was variability in the accuracy of the Nemeth elements, formatting, and tactile graphic labels across the transcriptions. Significant differences existed between the means of errors in formatting and literary braille according to NLS certification status and, to a lesser extent, job role. There was not a significant difference in the accuracy of Nemeth elements in the majority of the worksheets according to certification status or job role. There were no significant differences in the preparation of the worksheets based on primary production method. Discussion: There was variability in how materials were prepared for tactile readers and in the quality of the transcriptions. Implications for practitioners: Variation in how materials are presented to tactile readers, including the formatting of headings and directions, can affect the ease of scanning and reading of materials. Inconsistencies, omissions, and errors have the potential to impact the ability of readers to understand and access information. "

Problem solving and reasoning represent one of the most important aspects of a mathematics curriculum. The purpose of the present study was to examine how communication through writing in mathematics via a digital environment impacts the mathematical reasoning of students with and without learning disabilities. Specifically, the research was guided by research questions: (1) What differences exist between the mathematical reasoning of students with and without learning disabilities prior to and after using a digital writing environment? (2) How does use of the digital writing environment differ between students with and without learning disabilities? (3) To what extent does student reasoning change overtime when emphasis is placed on communication via writing in mathematics? Oral reading and math fact fluency as well as participants' working memory were used as academic variables. The Math Reasoning Inventory (MRI; Burns, 2012) is a formative assessment designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning through a face-to-face interview. The primary focus is on core numerical reasoning strategies and understanding. Subjects participated in an intervention focused on communication in mathematics through the use of digital writing tools in a computer-based mathematics program. Results reveal that communication through writing or peer-based discussions around mathematics can impact students' reasoning skills. Reasoning is a fundamental skill in mathematics and remains an area in which students with learning disabilities continuously struggle; therefore, interventions focused on advancing student reasoning will be increasingly pivotal to mathematics education. Students in this study showed improvement in different areas of reasoning over the course of the intervention and responded differently to the types of writing environments that were offered. Regardless of which digital environment was preferred by students with and without learning disabilities, results demonstrated that incorporating writing into mathematics to communicate mathematical information benefited all students in this study and has the potential to impact mathematics education."

Mathematical reasoning involves making sense of mathematical concepts in a logical way to form conclusions or judgments, and is often underdeveloped in students with learning disabilities. Technology-based environments have become a strategy to enhance students' reasoning in mathematics. Unfortunately, little research investigates the effects of technology on the reasoning skills of students with learning disabilities. This study examines the effects of an intervention intended to promote the communication of mathematical thinking through a digital writing environment for students with learning disabilities. We examined how students used the digital writing environment, the information communicated, and differences in mathematical reasoning for a small group of elementary students with learning disabilities (N = 13). Findings revealed students communicated primarily mathematical knowledge, preferred typing most of the time, and engaged in mathematical conversations with peers. Furthermore, significant differences in mathematical reasoning occurred over time."

As school districts respond to these directives they are looking for research-based practices to teach both students with disabilities and their non-disabled peers. In hopes of bringing about a significant and positive impact on student outcomes, the integration of computer technologies, particularly one-to-one laptop initiatives, has become wide-spread and costly (Bebell & Kay, 2010). However, despite the promise that one-to-one laptop initiatives bring to the field of education, there is a lack of large-scale research studies that focus on the impact of digital technologies on teaching and learning (Penuel, 2006, Bebell & O'Dwyer, 2010). The primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of Mooresville Graded School District's digital conversion and one-to-one laptop initiative on the academic achievement of its students with disabilities. Achievement data prior to the one-to-one laptop initiative and following implementation are compared using multiple chi-square tests. Data analysis indicate that the students did statistically significantly better on the Math and Reading End-of-Grade tests based on the frequency of pass rate. In an effort to deepen the scope of the project, the researcher also included a qualitative component. An examination of the perceptions of the special education teachers helping to implement the technology initiative is conducted through a Likert style survey. Analyses of this qualitative data indicate agreement and support of the quantitative findings. "

In this study I adopt an alternative approach using a response-to-intervention mathematical learning disabilities classification model and identify the resources students draw upon rather than the skills they lack. The intervention model involved videotaped one-on-one fraction tutoring sessions implemented with students with low mathematics achievement. This article presents case studies of two students who did not benefit from the tutoring sessions. Detailed diagnostic analyses of the sessions revealed that the students understood mathematical representations in atypical ways and that this directly contributed to the persistent difficulties they experienced. Implications for screening and remediation approaches are discussed.

The game relies on a graphical, intuitive representation for numbers and arithmetic operations to foster conceptual understanding and numbers sense, and provides a set of 2-player games to develop strategic thinking and reasoning skills. The game runs on computers and interactive white boards, and as an augmented reality application at a science centre. The study enrolled three teachers and eight students in 5th to 8th grade with intellectual disabilities who played the game over a period between four months and two years, one student with Asperger syndrome, and over 300 students in mainstream education as comparison. We compare the use of the game in special education and mainstream education with respect to usage, performance levels and learning gains. Collected data include game playing logs for all students where playing behaviour, performance, and progression data was analysed; class room and science centre observations where interaction, collaboration and communication was analysed, and on in-depth interviews with the teachers. The conclusion is that the game in combination with dedicated teachers can be very effective for students with intellectual disabilities, and can result in substantial gains in mathematical understanding and strategic thinking as well as in communication skills, given time and proper support.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of the calculator in grades 6, 7 and 8, as a standard accommodation during math instruction and assessment contributed to improved performance for students with learning disabilities. These students struggled with math and received special education services in this academic area before and during the use of the accommodation. The researcher also investigated whether the effect of this accommodation varied with the type of special education program awarded (inclusion, resource, self-contained). The theoretical foundation of the study was cognitive deficit theory that focused on working memory deficits. A quantitative, causal-comparative research design was conducted using archival data from a small school district to compare the performance of the students with learning disabilities on the grade level state standardized assessment before the implementation of the calculator as a standard accommodation and afterwards. The results of paired samples t tests and a two-way mixed ANOVA were statistically significant, showing that students who used the calculator performed at a higher level. The special education program did not influence the effect of using the calculator; all students with learning disabilities benefitted from using this accommodation. The implications of these findings suggest that calculators allow students with learning disabilities to learn key concepts by addressing the cognitive deficit challenges of retrieving basic math facts.

Mathematical problem solving is a critical, higher order skill that students need to have in order to solve real-world problems, but there is currently limited research on teaching problem solving to students with autism spectrum disorders and moderate intellectual disability. This study investigated the effects of schema-based instruction delivered through computer-based video instruction on the acquisition of mathematical problem solving skills, as well as the ability to discriminate problem type, to three elementary-aged students with autism spectrum disorders and moderate intellectual disability using a single-case multiple probe across participants design. The study also examined participant's ability to generalize skills to a paper-and-pencil format. Results showed a functional relation between schema-based instruction delivered through computer-based video instruction and the participants' mathematical word problem solving skills, ability to discriminate problem type, and generalization to novel problems in paper-and-pencil format. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using computer-based video instruction to teach higher order mathematical content to students with autism spectrum disorders and moderate intellectual disability, and offers suggestions for future research in this area.

Several pedagogically designed computer-based mediums attempt to address these issues. Research suggests computer-based mediums, such as intelligent tutoring systems, show an attrition of benefit with every year of academic growth. Outside of advanced course work, these mediums offer little to no instructional benefit for students at the secondary level. The derived condition places secondary-level students with persistent deficits in mathematics in a detrimental learning condition. Students with persistent deficits in mathematics mimic the Learning Difficulties seen in students' with mathematical learning disabilities and their low-achieving peers. They present some of the mathematical difficulties seen with mathematical learning disabilities, the inconsistent performance seen in their low-achieving peers, along with poor performance over multiple years and outcome measures. The ubiquitous presentation of persistent deficits in mathematics inhibits the identification and remediation necessary to improve instructional outcomes. There is a significant gap in the literature on effective strategies and approaches to mathematical difficulties for secondary students and on the instructional variables influencing outcomes for these students. In consequence, the instructional demands of secondary education for students' with persistent deficits in mathematics leverages their future against their ability to learn. This study sought to assess the efficacy of engagement time for students' with persistent deficits in mathematics as it pertains to the development of algebraic competency, while using Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS), an intelligent tutoring systems, as the medium of instruction. With this in mind, a cross-sectional analysis was done using 138 ninth-grade students, performing in the lowest quartile of performance, across three high schools using ALEKS as a part of their supplemental instruction to characterize the instructional effect of engagement time. This study controlled for gender, socioeconomic level, prior reading achievement, prior math achievement, and attendance. Measures of central tendency were used to identify correlations and make predictions about future performance. Results revealed that engagement showed no significant relationship with any curriculum-based measurement. However, they also revealed that students' with persistent deficits in mathematics showed incremental growth toward closing the achievement gap and that the number of skills mastered per hour was a greater predictor of future outcomes."

The research participants (seven eighth grade students classified as having a mild intellectual disability or learning disability) were administered two forms of a mathematics assessment, a universally designed computer-based test and a paper-based test. Qualitative methodology was utilized to investigate the experiences these participants incurred while taking the two types of test. Data were gathered through document analyses, observations, in-depth interviews, and a focus group interview. Methods triangulation was employed to analyze the viewpoints of the participants gathered through these procedures. Research outcomes revealed that most of the participants (N = 5) demonstrated higher achievement on the paper-based mathematics assessment. Though several students (N = 4) perceived the universally designed computer-based mathematics test to be more accessible than the paper-based mathematics test, five of the seven participants made fewer errors on the paper-based assessment. These findings indicated that students' perceptions of an evaluation instrument do not necessarily impact the assessment outcomes. "

Yet, their role as an accommodation is not without controversy. Using a single-subject design study, the researchers explored if students with disabilities solve more mathematics problems aligned to grade-level standards when they use a calculator than when they do not. The researchers also analyzed whether calculators assist students more with solving computation versus word problems. On average, students answered more questions correctly when they had access to a calculator. However, the tool was not generally an effective intervention given the low percentage of nonoverlapping data and, generally, small Tau-U for each student as well as instability and decreasing trends. The results lacked a consistent pattern of students benefiting from calculator use with regard to answering computation versus word problems. "

Although research suggests that app-based instruction can be effective, there is a paucity of research comparing app-based instruction, to teacher-directed instruction or to a combination of instructional approaches involving both app-based instruction and teacher-directed instruction in tandem. In an alternating treatments design, we compared app-based instruction, teacher-directed instruction, and combination of instructional approaches conditions during instruction targeting multiplication facts with six students with learning disabilities. Results were inconsistent across students, and no condition emerged as consistently better than the others. Students completed social validity rating scales, and all approaches were favored by at least one student. Our results support findings from previous research involving similar comparisons between these instructional formats in which no (or minimal) differences across conditions were detected. We conclude that there may not be a meaningful difference between the outcomes achieved using app-based instruction, teacher-directed instruction, or combination of instructional approaches for many students. Results are discussed in terms of directions for the future research. "

Methods: The data for this study were collected via a mixed-methods online survey distributed through professional networks to reach teachers with experience supporting students who are braille readers in advanced mathematics. A device matrix was used to ask participants about three interrelated issues. First, which of the 35 assistive technologies presented did they use to aid students? Second, how was the technology implemented? And third, how did they rate the effectiveness of each device used? Open-response items provided space for additional tools and other feedback. Results: A total of 82 surveys were completed through the device matrix question. Results conclusively indicated that 20 of the 35 technologies were used; of these, 13 were used regardless of subject. More than half of the participants indicated that the same four technologies were implemented for student information access during class, guided practice, and independent practice. Participants recommended seven technologies not included in the device matrix through the open-response questions. Discussion: This survey revealed that teachers of visually impaired students are using assistive technology for multiple functions. A core set of 13 devices emerged, as well as varying subsets for specific tasks across different subjects. Limitations of the study were the small sample size and possible survey fatigue. Implications for practitioners: By examining the uses of technology presented in this article, teachers can determine which assistive technology might be worth exploring to use for preparation of materials for students and which to teach others to use independently for reading or preparation of assignments in advanced mathematics courses.

In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, mathematics serves as the key to other areas (science, technology and engineering). Existing evidence shows that an integrated curriculum in mathematics enhanced the majority of students' performances on standardized tests. However, many visually-impaired students seem to fail to reach proficiency in mathematics. In this paper, we present a new approach to promote vision-impaired students' overall math performance and enrich their learning experiences. We first investigated student Learning Difficulties and then developed a new mathematics curriculum with the integration of the Digital Accessible Information System. This curriculum mainly addresses Digital Accessible Information System-compliant electronic textbooks that can be displayed on a Non-Visual Desktop Access screen reader. Finally, we conducted an experiment in order to evaluate the effects of the new teaching approach. The experiment included a four-day pedagogical program and an assessment session. Specifically, the test focused on students' mathematics scores and their NASA-TLX subjective mental workload. The findings showed that the value of the NASA-TLX subjective scales (t = 4.271, p < 0.05) was significant and the student accuracy rate increased. Thus, we conclude that this new method effectively improved vision-impaired students' proficiency in mathematics. "

Chemistry appears to have considerable potential for being spoken ambiguously and may be a barrier to accessing knowledge and to learning. Educators in chemistry may be unaware of, or have limited awareness of, potential ambiguity in speaking chemistry and may speak chemistry ambiguously to their students. One purpose of this paper is to increase awareness of potential ambiguity in speaking chemistry and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields and the ramifications of ambiguity. Another purpose is to introduce rules (known as MathSpeak) for non-ambiguous speaking of mathematics that could be adapted for use in chemistry. Reducing ambiguity in speaking chemistry may enhance learning of chemistry and could encourage students who have blindness, visual impairments, and/or other print disabilities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields."

However, when accessible technology and instruction are provided using universal design for learning principles, research indicates that many students benefit with increased achievement. Learning through universally designed and accessible technology is essential for students with disabilities who, without access, would not gain the skills needed to complete their degrees and access employment and a life of self-sufficiency. universal design for learning strategies enhance learning for all students, including students with disabilities who are majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which are among the most rigorous academic disciplines, but also among the most financially rewarding careers."

Conceptualized within a Universal Design for Learning framework, the eWorkbook aimed to reduce barriers to math instruction by providing multimedia-enhanced interactive math practice, allowing for student choice, incorporating familiar tools and supports, and leveraging evidence-based teaching practices. Results indicate students are more accurate and independent when using the eWorkbook compared to the traditional paper-pencil worksheet. Additional affordances of the eWorkbook include fostering unique opportunities for the understanding and expression of mathematical knowledge and promoting self-regulation skills."

Their recommendations encourage educators to make decisions regarding technology based on the individual needs of each child, with the goal of improving student outcomes in mathematics achievement. For students with disabilities, the advancement of instructional technology in academics comes with the recognition that not all technology is suitable for all types of learners. For students with a learning disability in mathematics, there exists a sizable body of literature studying various technologies and pedagogical practices for teaching secondary mathematics curriculum. However, with the growing footprint of computer-based technologies in today's classrooms, some areas of study, such as the use of virtual manipulatives lack sufficient exploration. Although concrete manipulatives were studied for many decades for students with learning disabilities and are considered a best practice, the research base for virtual manipulatives is notably less. With a specific focus on algebraic instruction, this study sought to compare the benefits of both forms of manipulative to assist secondary students with a learning disability in mathematics to solve single variable linear equations using a single-subject alternating treatment design. Over the course of 30 sessions of intervention, three students exhibited over 90% average accuracy solving problems using both virtual and concrete manipulatives, while the concrete manipulative earned higher scores for two of the three students.

Emily's teacher and assistive technology team thought that controlling a robot would motivate Emily to ""use her speech generating device more"".; Method: A descriptive case study was used because the integration of communication and manipulation technologies is not yet understood. Target activities and goals were chosen by Emily's teacher and assistive technology team. Emily performed several manipulative math activities and engaged in an ""acting"" activity aimed at increasing her message length. The competency skills needed to control a robot from the speech generating device were examined, as well as stakeholder satisfaction with the robot system.; Results: Emily generated up to 0.4 communication events and 7 robot commands per minute in the activities. Her length of utterance was usually one-word long, but she generated two- and three-word utterances during some activities. Observations of Emily informed a framework to describe the competency skills needed to use speech generating devices to control robots. Emily and her teacher expressed satisfaction with robot use.; Conclusion: Robot use could motivate students to build speech generating device operational skills and learn educational concepts. Implications for Rehabilitation Controlling a robot from a speech-generating device could increase students' motivation, engagement and understanding in learning educational concepts, because of the hands-on enactive approach. The robot and speech generating device system was acceptable to the participant and teacher and elicited positive comments from classmates. Thus, it may provide a way for children with disabilities to link with the curriculum and with other students in the classroom. Controlling a robot via speech generating device presents opportunities to improve augmentative and alternative communication operational, linguistic, social and strategic skills. Careful choice of activities will ensure that the activity requirements focus on the desired target skill, e.g. drawing or playing board games could be helpful to build operational skills and acting out stories could be helpful for building linguistic skills."

The games involved declarative, procedural, as well as conceptual knowledge of multiplicative relations, and were accompanied with teacherled lessons and class discussions. A pretest-posttest control-group design was employed, with 81 students from five schools for special primary education (three experimental schools and two control schools). The intervention consisted of two 10-week game periods inwhich a total of 16 mini-games were offered as part of the regular educational program for multiplicative reasoning. The control group students played non-multiplicative mini-games; for multiplicative reasoning, they followed their regular educational program without mini-games. In both groups, students' multiplicative reasoning ability significantly increased. Regarding declarative knowledge of multiplication facts, learning outcomes were significantly higher in the experimental group as compared with the control group. This finding indicates the usefulness of mini-games for enhancing special education students' mathematics fact knowledge. Learning outcomes on a test measuring procedural and conceptual knowledge of multiplicative reasoning did not differ between experimental and control group. For these learning outcomes, then, the mini-games intervention did not have added value but can still be considered a ""safe"" alternative approach."

This study proposes a computerized intervention tool, the integrated dynamic representation, for enhancing the early learning of basic mathematical competencies and word problem solving skills. The goal was to compare and contrast the effects of IDR on the acquisition of informal and formal mathematical competencies in students with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mathematical learning difficulties. Participants were 216 students (6-9 years), who were classified into three groups: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 72), mathematical learning difficulties (n = 82), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mathematical learning difficulties (n = 62). They completed the ""Test of Early Mathematics Ability"" (Third Edition). The results showed that all three diagnosed groups improved significantly postintervention in all mathematical competencies, with the mathematical learning difficulties-only group benefiting the most at posttest."

The objective of this study is to show how the use of a digital educational resource can help improve the mathematical performance of children with dyscalculia. In particular, how the systematic application of a digital resource improves the resolution of subtraction, compared to the resolution of such operation without it. The study was carried out by applying a learning sequence of systematized subtraction and adapting it to the specific difficulties of the student and then selecting a motivating digital resource. Our results suggest that the use of this resource has made outstanding contributions to the achievement of this mathematical operation. It is recommended to carry out studies in this line to contribute to improving the learning process of school children with these difficulties."

Although Virtual Learning Environments are rapidly increasing in educational practice, at present there is insufficient evidence to identify whether remedial Virtual Learning Environments are more efficient at improving understanding of particular mathematical concepts. The purpose of this study was to identify the extent to which students' academic gains differ after completing a remedial Virtual Learning Environment for Integrated Algebra for the following mathematical topics: Algebra, Geometry, Probability and Statistics, Measurement, and Number Sense and Operations. Additionally, this study sought to identify whether these academic gains differ according to gender, ethnicity, and whether the student was classified as having a disability enrolled in a remedial Virtual Learning Environment for Integrated Algebra. A comparison of means revealed that a remedial Virtual Learning Environment in Integrated Algebra best supported students' learning in Number Sense and Operations, while students struggled most with Probability and Statistics. However, since these were the only two strands to content areas to show significance, these results only mildly support a Virtual Learning Environment as remediation in mathematics. The data indicate which Integrated Algebra topics are best taught in remedial Integrated Algebra Virtual Learning Environments. These results allow educators to design Virtual Learning Environments that remedy the shortcomings and exploit the advantages of these interventions. Additionally, with the information gained in this study, educators can design Virtual Learning Environment programs that best promote student success. "

Participants learned to solve two types of group word problems: missing-whole and missing-part. The themes of the word problems were related to their interests and daily experiences. In addition, participants were taught key mathematics vocabulary terms using constant time delay. Participants were taught how to use an iPad that displayed a task analysis with embedded verbal and specific verbal prompts to complete each step of solving the real-world algebra word problems. This study also examined participant's ability to generalize skills when stimulus supports were faded. Results showed a functional relation between constant time delay and acquisition of mathematics vocabulary terms as well as between modified schema-based instruction and mathematical problem solving. Participants were able to successfully solve both types of group problems and had some success with generalizing skills when stimulus supports were faded. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using modified schema-based instruction to teach mathematical problem solving to students with autism spectrum disorder and moderate intellectual disability, and offer suggestions for future research in this area.

However, no direct evidence on this problem exists, and findings on whether or not test accommodations improve test scores are persistently mixed. A key issue underlying both problems is the failure to account for contextual attributes. We propose students' skill range--the breadth of knowledge and skills they acquire--as a fundamental contextual variable. A wider skill range implies a broader and thus more complex skillset. Under such conditions, more students with disabilities are likely to legitimately need test accommodations. Gaming is thus suspect when a high percentage of students with disabilities are given test accommodations and the skill range is narrow. Based on state-level panel data (2007-2009) for eighth graders, we find that states with a wider mathematics skill range indeed use test accommodations more commonly, and that under such conditions test accommodations do not necessarily result in greater proficiency gains, suggesting that gaming may be less likely in such states. Proficiency gains from test accommodations are greatest in states where the mathematics skill range is markedly narrower, yet a high percentage of students with disabilities are nonetheless given test accommodations. We offer a number of competing heuristic explanations of gaming and no-gaming under a wider set of combinations for skill range and test accommodations, which are testable in future research. We follow this with a discussion of broader implications for scholarship and practice. "

Although concrete manipulatives were studied for many decades for students with a learning disability and are considered a best practice, the research base for virtual manipulatives is notably less. With a specific focus on algebraic instruction, this study sought to compare the benefits of both forms of manipulatives to assist secondary students with a learning disability in mathematics to solve single-variable linear equations using a single-subject alternating treatment design. Over the course of 30 sessions of intervention, three students exhibited over 90% average accuracy solving problems using both virtual and concrete manipulatives, while the concrete manipulative earned higher scores for two of the three students.

However, teachers' perceptions of which differentiated-instruction program works best to support differently abled students were unknown. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore teachers' perceptions on whether face-to-face instruction using response to intervention or computer-based learning using TenMarks works best in improving the academic performance of students who are differently abled in mathematics, specifically geometry. Constructivism, social disability theory, and Bandura's social learning theory formed the study's theoretical framework. Research questions guiding the study focused on teachers' perceptions of the advantages and challenges of traditional face-to-face instruction versus TenMarks when educating differently abled students. Data were collected through one-on-one interviews and member checking using a purposeful sample with six high school mathematic teachers. Thematic data analysis followed an open coding process to identify emergent themes. The findings showed that teachers perceived advantages and challenges with both instructional models. Further, teachers believed combining the two approaches would be most beneficial as the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches are complementary, which correlates with disability's social and critical models. This study contributes to positive social change through school administrators and teachers in guiding school policies and practices related to differentiated-instruction approaches in classrooms that include differently abled students.

This study was a follow-up to a previous study. Method Three students with cerebral palsy used the robot to measure objects using non-standard units, such as straws, and then compared and ordered the objects using the resulting measurement. Their performance was assessed, and the manipulation and communication events were observed. Teachers and education assistants were interviewed regarding robot use. Results Similar benefits to the previous study were found in this study. Gaps in student procedural knowledge were identified such as knowing to place measurement units tip-to-tip, and students' reporting revealed gaps in conceptual understanding. However, performance improved with repeated practice. Stakeholders identified that some robot tasks took too long or were too difficult to perform. Conclusions Having access to both their speech generating device and a robot gave the students multiple ways to show their understanding of the measurement concepts. Though they could participate actively in the new mathematics activities, robot use is most appropriate in short tasks requiring reasonable operational skill. Implications for Rehabilitation Lego robots controlled via speech-generating devices can help students to engage in the mathematics pedagogy of performing hands-on activities while communicating about concepts. Students can ""show what they know"" using the Lego robots, and report and reflect on concepts using the speech generating device. Level 1 and Level 2 mathematics measurement activities have been adapted to be accomplished by the Lego robot. Other activities can likely be accomplished with similar robot adaptations (e.g., gripper, pen). It is not recommended to use the robot to measure items that are long, or perform measurements that require high operational competence in order to be successful."

For more than a decade, research has shown Enhanced anchored Instruction to be effective in improving the math achievement of students with disabilities. Enhanced anchored Instruction is based on situated cognition learning theory and combines multimedia-based instruction with hands-on problems in real world contexts. anchored Instruction with Technology Applications integrates technology applications such as three-dimensional printers with Enhanced anchored Instruction curriculum for improving problem-solving skills of students with disabilities. The study examined differential effects of anchored Instruction with Technology Applications in resource rooms and inclusive classrooms. Results showed significant improvement in favor of anchored Instruction with Technology Applications for students with disabilities in both problem-solving and computation performance. "

He was blind, mobility impaired, and he could not speak above a whisper. Logan was not able to use traditional low vision tools like braille and Nemeth code because he lacked the sensitivity in his fingers required to read the raised dots. Logan's need for tools that would enable him to perform the rigorous algebraic manipulations that are common in mathematics courses led to the development of Process-Driven Math. With this method, he was able to succeed in both college algebra and pre-calculus with trigonometry. These tools may help other visually impaired students who are not succeeding in mathematics because they lack access to, or knowledge of, the Nemeth code. Within many algebraic problems, there are processes (algorithms) that must be performed to simplify expressions and solve for variables. Process-Driven Math frees up working memory during the delivery of the mathematic content to the student, and during the student's subsequent manipulation of the equation while working toward a solution. As a result, the student who cannot use or access Nemeth code can better focus on the required algorithms because the cognitive load on working memory is greatly reduced. When using this method, a person who functions as the student's reader and scribe systematically reveals the algebraic expression in layers. The process is highly interactive and places control over the flow of information into the hands of the student."

Without these skills, students may face increased challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including fewer post-secondary educational opportunities, limited career options, and decreased long-term income. Addressing low math skills is important to improving options for students with disabilities. Research indicates that technology-based interventions have the potential to improve academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the math instructional technology used in secondary math classrooms with students with disabilities. The study also examined teacher-perceived barriers and desired supports related to the integration of technology. A three-round Delphi method was used to collect survey data from participants. Participants were 36 secondary general and special education teachers who were identified as experts by their school principals and currently teaching secondary math to students with disabilities in co-teach and/or resource settings. Expertise criteria included a standard teaching license, experience using instructional software with students, and a minimum of three years of experience teaching students with disabilities in co-teach and/or resource settings. The results indicated that participants most frequently used ""ALEKS,"" ""Kahoot,"" ""ST Math,"" or no instructional software in math instruction for students with disabilities. Software selection was based on software availability, software features, or no specific selection methods. Participants identified lack of time, cost, and lack of technology as barriers to implementation. The most frequently identified desired supports were training and support, additional technology, and no supports, and participants perceived technology as increasing engagement, improving math outcomes, or having an unknown impact on math performance. These findings have implications for administrators, practitioners, researchers, and teacher preparation program developers. Instructional software continues to be underutilized in secondary math classrooms with students with disabilities, and the instructional software programs that are utilized do not have a strong evidence base. Administrators and practitioners should use a rigorous decision-making process to select and implement evidence-based instructional software to improve the math outcomes of students with disabilities. Administrators should also provide ongoing training to teachers to support technology integration.

This kind of information is an indispensable component for up-to-date math learning and teaching. Due to the limitation of other senses and assistive devices for blind people, this missing of explicit semantic mark-up of these implicit didactical elements is seen as one key reason for the disadvantages of in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and related job opportunities. This paper presents basic research on developing an approach for making this implicit information accessible by marking-up the implicit visual elements used in math schoolbooks, which goes beyond linear text. Describing and marking-up this dynamic content forms the base for our prototyping of an inclusive math-learning environment for blind students. Interactive dialogues guide the blind user and provide assistive functionalities for better managing the complexity when solving math problems using sequential audio, refreshable braille display, and other presentation and interaction methods. In this attempt, our prototype covers four basic arithmetic operations. We use the Eclipse Standard Widget Toolkit framework and Microsoft user interface Automation to be in line with known accessibility concepts and skills of users. The prototypes have been evaluated both by blind and sighted persons. "

Methods: A multiple baseline design across three target skills was used with two participants, ages 9 and 11, to assess the effects on academic skill acquisition (e.g. calculating fractions and percentages, identifying synonyms). Additionally, we assessed for potential iatrogenic effects of using a highly preferred electronic device in intervention by measuring engagement in stereotypy and challenging behavior. Results: Video-enhanced activity schedules were effective in teaching both participants to independently complete a variety of academic skills. Generalization across untaught stimuli and four-week maintenance of academic skill improvement was observed. Undesirable increases in stereotypy were not observed and challenging behavior improved over the course of the study. Conclusion: Video-enhanced activity schedules may represent an efficient treatment option for teaching new skills which reduces the need for teacher-delivered prompts and increases the independence of children with autism spectrum disorder."

Specifically, the study compared student achievement in iLearnNYC schools, to their peer schools that deliver instruction in a traditional manner. iLearnNYC is a blended learning program where online content complements in-class teaching and allows students more control over the pace in which they learn, where they learn, and what they learn. A quasi-experimental quantitative design was used to analyze test scores on the June 2014 and June 2015 administration of the New York State Common Core Algebra I exams (Appendix B & C) for both the blended learning and the traditional learning groups. Statistical analyses was performed on the data to determine the differences in students' mean scores, as well as differences in achievement levels for various sub-groups of the sample. The study found that students in the Blended Learning group (iLearnNYC schools) did not have statistically significant greater mean scores in overall performance on Common Core Algebra I Regents exam than their peers in the Traditional Learning group (peer schools). This study also found that Students with Disability (SWD's) in the traditional learning group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the blended learning group. Additionally, there was not a significant difference for English Language Learners (ELLS) between the blended learning and the traditional groups. This study concludes that other variables such as students' prior academic results, students' attendance, and teachers' experience should be considered if blended learning is to be used as a comprehensive school reform model to increase students' overall performance on state standardized math exams. Transitioning from a traditional to a blended model can produce many challenges. These challenges can relate primarily to faculty and learner time; level of effort; familiarity, skill, and comfort-level with online platform (Lotrecchiano et al., 2013)."

Many classrooms have access to mobile devices, such as iPads and Kindles, and educators utilize these devices to differentiate instruction and augment teacher-led instruction. This delivery method, known as blended learning, can create an enriched learning environment where students are exposed to individualized lessons that are self-paced and provide multiple modes of presentation. However, there is little empirical investigation into how students interact with digital devices or what components of online learning directly impact student learning and engagement with the content. In order to design authentic learning experiences that support students with disabilities and provide access to the general education curriculum, it is critical that researchers thoroughly examine the design on digital lessons and how students navigate digital environments. The focus of this study was to investigate how students use mobile devices in a classroom setting and how they interact with academic content delivered in a digital format. The math achievement and engagement of students with disabilities was compared in two conditions - teacher-led math instruction (Traditional Math Instruction) and instruction delivered on a mobile device (Mobile App Instruction). Additionally, teacher and student perceptions of math knowledge and engagement were collected for both conditions using surveys. The surveys were administered after the intervention was completed. The results of the study indicate neither instructional method was significantly more effective in increasing the math achievement or the engagement of students with disabilities. Survey data revealed the teacher did not feel one condition was more effective at increasing math achievement or engagement. Data from the student surveys indicated that students in the Traditional Math Instruction condition felt they learned more and were more engaged than the students in the Mobile App Instruction condition. Observational data indicated there was no significant difference in engagement for students in the Traditional Math Instruction group and the Mobile App Instruction group. Data collected from the online learning platform suggested students easily accessed the lessons and completed embedded activities and questions. However, data from the learning videos indicate students accessed the videos but did not watch them through to completion, and did not answer the embedded questions. "

The current advent of assistive learning technologies holds promise in helping students with visual impairments learn mathematics, particularly through making mathematics accessible in nonvisual ways. In this critical literature review, two authors, one blind and one sighted, use a disability studies and rehumanizing mathematics education framework to examine currently available assistive learning technologies. We organize our findings using the substitution, augmentation, modification, and redefinition (SAMR) model, then critique the technologies based on their capacity for humanizing students with visual impairments in mathematics learning. We found that most technologies rely on a substitution or augmentation model, merely replacing visual information with audio or tactile information and then requiring students with visual impairments to “act” more like their sighted peers. We found few technologies that recognized the unique mathematical experiences students with visual impairments hold, or empowered students with visual impairments to create and own their own mathematical knowledge through collaboration with all students on the spectrum of vision.

In this multiple probe across behaviors replicated across two participants study, the researchers explored the effectiveness of the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence to support two students' acquisition of three mathematical behaviors. Each student was able to acquire his or her three mathematical behaviors (i.e., place value, single-digit addition with regrouping, subtraction with regrouping, and single-digit multiplication) following instruction with the Virtual-representational-abstract sequence. However, each student struggled with maintenance with at least one behavior. Implications for practice relative to the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence are discussed."

The most common manipulatives are concrete manipulatives, yet app-based manipulatives are a viable age-appropriate option for secondary students with disabilities. Through an adapted alternating treatment design with three middle school students--two with mild intellectual disability and one with a learning disability, researchers explored the impact of virtual and concrete manipulatives on students' accuracy, independence, and task completion time for solving addition of fractions with unlike denominators. Students were equally successful in terms of accuracy and differences with independence were minimal. When comparing the two manipulative types, the results were idiosyncratic; two students were more independent with the concrete manipulative and one with the app-based manipulative. Implications for research regarding mathematics instruction and use of concrete and app-based manipulatives are discussed."

Historically, educators have used concrete manipulatives to support and build conceptual understanding. Mobile devices provide a valuable option to support students with disabilities in mathematics through app-based manipulatives. Although research is limited on app-based manipulatives, the emerging literature with virtual (i.e., digital) manipulatives more generally suggests student preference for virtual manipulatives without a loss of understanding. This column provides educators with information about app-based manipulatives and how to use them, with the goal of helping teachers make informed decisions about app-based manipulatives to support students.

thesis,"Brosh, C. R. ",2018,Effects of a multi-component intervention package on academic skills for students with severe disabilities,multi-component intervention.//academic skills.//students.//severe disabilities.//Academic Achievement.//Disabilities.//Intervention,"The current study evaluated the effects of a multi-component intervention package (modified schema-based instruction) with systematic feedback in the consequent event) on mathematical problem-solving and embedded non-targeted science and English language arts (ELA) comprehension for three elementary students with moderate and severe intellectual disability. Using systematic instruction with a system of least prompts, a task analysis and a graphic organizer with manipulatives, participants learned to solve group word problems: using addition to solve for the part-part-whole relationship. In addition to learning how to solve addition word problems, participants were also taught grade-aligned science and ELA concepts using non-targeted information presented as instructive feedback in the consequent event. Generalization of mathematical problem-solving to a digital presentation using an iPad was also measured. In addition, this study also examined participant's ability to generalize mathematical problem-solving skills when stimulus supports (i.e., task analysis and graphic organizer) were faded from the instructional package. Results showed a functional relation between modified schema-based instruction and mathematical problem-solving and between embedded non-targeted information as systematic feedback in the consequent event and science and ELA knowledge. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using multi-component intervention packages to teach academic skills (modified schema-based instruction to teach mathematical problem-solving while simultaneously presenting non-targeted information as systematic feedback to teach discrete academic skills) to students with moderate and severe intellectual disability. Limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are discussed. "

There are two existing models in screening dyscalculia: IQ-Achievement Discrepancy Model (DM), and Response to Instruction (RTI) model. In these models, two different cut-off based criteria (being 1 or 2 standard deviation below within their age groups, and being in the lower 5-10% group) are mainly used. The main purpose of this study is to compare these two different cut-off criteria, based on three sub-tests of Tablet-PC Based Dyscalculia Screening Battery (TAB-DSB) (Canonic Dot Counting-CDC, Symbolic Number Comparison-SNC and Mental Number Line-MNL). It is expected to show which criteria would yield the best discrimination in differentiating students who have dyscalculia tendency from the rest of the students in three sub-tests. Methods: The participants of the study included 316 volunteer 1st, 2nd. and 3rd year elementary school students. Results and Conclusion: The results indicated that CDC, SNC, and MNL (MNL1, MNL2) tasks failed to discriminate the groups when the standard deviation rule (below, above, and within 1 standard deviation) was taken into consideration. On the other hand, these tasks were found to be effective in discriminating the groups when the lower 10% and the upper groups were compared."

Implications for Students with Visual Impairments,Textbooks -- Evaluation.//Audiovisual materials.//Content analysis.//Students with disabilities.//Mathematics.//Research funding.//Vision disorders.//Medical coding.//Descriptive statistics,"Introduction: Visually impaired students (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) have difficulty accessing curricular material in mathematical textbooks because many mathematics texts have visual images that contain important content information that are not transcribed or described in digital versions of the texts. However, little is known about the extent to which this issue exists within texts and what sort of information is contained in visual material in mathematics texts. This article describes a process undertaken to classify images in a selection of math textbooks that are currently being used in grades 5, 8, and 11. Methods: Representative textbooks were chosen that aligned with Common Core Standards. An exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of image categories was developed, researchers became reliable on coding procedures, and then all images in the representative texts were coded. Results: The most common images involved student interest, motivation, and organization, but contained little or no math content. The second most common area of image categories often contained large amounts of math content but were difficult to describe succinctly or might have been described without including important mathematical information. This grouping included tables, line graphs, and images specifically related to a single question. The final group of less frequently appearing images included ray or line diagrams, number lines, pie charts, bar graphs, and maps. Discussion: To improve access to visual math content, the focus should be on images that appear frequently and contain math content such as tables, scatter or line graphs, shapes, equations, and images specifically related to a single question. Less common image categories such as models, line diagrams, pictures of calculator keys, and number lines lend themselves easily to description. Implications for practitioners: Optimization of limited instructional time would be accomplished by having teachers focus on students' understanding of the most common types of images, such as tables and line graphs.

This study investigated how much description is sufficient to communicate math content in different types of images. Methods: Representative math textbooks from grades five, eight, and 11, aligned to the Common Core, were selected. Mutually exclusive and exhaustive image categories were identified. Clear examples of each image category were chosen, and digital files were created containing the examples and surrounding textual material. Files replicated the printed page as closely as possible, and all elements (words, math expressions, and descriptions of images) were readable by JAWS. Forty-four students who are visually impaired (that is, those who are blind or had low vision) listened to the math pages and answered questions related to the content contained in the images. Results: Students answered content-related questions better with more description, but across four description conditions with varying amounts of description the highest correct rate was low (29%). In looking at individual image categories, students had the most correct answers for number lines (41.0%). Rates of 20% to 33% correct were demonstrated for image categories of shapes, tables, line graphs, bar graphs, and ray diagrams. Correct rates for equations, pie charts, and maps were inconsistent or lower than 15%. Students were positive about math and did not indicate many problems with math texts. Discussion: Descriptions of visual images can communicate important math information, but there are images for which no level of description is sufficient. Many students in the study were not aware of how much visual math content to which they were not provided access. Implications for practitioners: Math texts need to be more accessible for students who are visually impaired. Although describing visual images can improve access to content, that may not be sufficient. Materials should be provided in several formats simultaneously so students can approach material in the mode that fits their needs in a variety of contexts. "
journal_article,"García, L., Salazar, A., García, M., Hernandez, S., & Gomez, C.",2018,Video Game Analytics and Down Syndrome,Video games in education.//Education of people with down syndrome.//Down syndrome.//Information & communication technologies.//Social integration,"Today there are many children with Down Syndrome who have difficulties in the teaching-learning process in general and in particular in mathematics. These difficulties have their primary origin in the intellectual disability that is manifested to a greater or lesser extent in people with Down Syndrome due to a genetic alteration characterized by an additional copy of chromosome 21. This genetic imbalance causes a decrease in the number of neurons and synaptic connections which in turn makes mental and motor processes slower for them than for other people. Notwithstanding the preceding, the population retains its capacity for learning and improvement, even there is no limit to the development of their skill is as long as they provide the right incentives. On the other hand,  information and communication technologies have proven to be an inclusive tool with the population in cognitive impairment such as Down Syndrome. Experts affirm that these people do have interest and can make use of technologies, which constitute a valuable instrument to increase the probability of becoming more independent and active in the community. In this sense, actions have been undertaken to promote the social inclusion of this population by promoting access to  information and communication technology, respecting their right to access information and communication. In this way, the digital divide is reduced, and educational, labor and social inclusion are favored. According to the above, the design of a prototype of an educational video game in mathematics that is inclusive with people with Down Syndrome was proposed. This game is based on three own activities of daily living of people who require basic knowledge in mathematics. Each of the activities starts at a basic level of difficulty, and to the extent that the user manages to perform each of them adequately, the difficulty of them will increase. The objective of the first activity of the game is to identify shapes and colors correctly, the other is to count, and the last is to organize elements according to form. Since some users with or without Down Syndrome can have limitations in language development, the game was designed so that from the same user interaction with the application could be obtained data showing some aspects of the teaching-learning process and familiarization and use of the proposed tool. These analytical data extracted directly from the interaction with the game facilitates the evaluation of it, especially in populations where language is not fully developed and thus have limitations in intelligibility and speech.

A review of the literature revealed 19 studies (9 single-case and 10 group/quasi experimental designs) published between 2000 and 2016. Results suggest that technology-mediated mathematics interventions had mainly positive results on the mathematics outcomes of students with or at risk for mathematics learning disabilities. This study also examined the extent to which principles of explicit instruction were integrated in technology-mediated mathematics interventions. While many of the interventions provided frequent practice opportunities with academic feedback, few complemented such practice opportunities with overt demonstrations and explanations of mathematical content. Implications for designing technology-mediated mathematics interventions are discussed."

Recently, game researchers have highlighted the need for paying more attention to identifying the game design choices that can strengthen learning. This paper reviews recent studies in the field of games that aim at supporting people with difficulties in learning, particularly in basic reading and maths skills. We identify the major characteristics and learning outcomes of the reviewed studies, as well as key design principles that have been used in games for enhancing basic reading and maths skills. The results show that people with specific Learning Difficulties have positive improvements in the quality of learning. We also found specific gamification elements that have been used to promote the learning of basic reading and maths skills. However, we call for research, which would explicitly examine the effects of game design choices on learning. Currently, the studies that address learning disabilities do not specifically define which kind of games and game design the results refer to, while game design studies do not clarify how these games influence learning. Thus, there is a need to rethink previous empirical studies on game settings for people with Learning Difficulties via advancing the role of game design in empirical intervention studies. "

Although use of Information and Communication Technology can improve these outcomes for traditional students, it has been unclear whether its use positively affects learning gains for the inclusion student. The purpose of this study was to determine if the academic test performance of 5th grade Exceptional Student Education inclusion students was enhanced by implementing Information and Communication Technology as a curriculum resource in their classrooms. Two frameworks provided structure for this study: the theory of social constructivism and the capability approach. The study population consisted of all 5th grade Exceptional Student Education inclusion students in 74 school districts in one southern state. Data sources were the state's annual assessment scores for English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. Data were analyzed using 2 Mann Whitney U tests to compare Exceptional Student Education inclusion students' assessment scores in the 2nd year of testing as compared to the 1st year of testing (2015-2016 as compared to 2014-2015). The findings of the study revealed no significant difference between the Exceptional Student Education inclusion students' scores in the 1st and 2nd years for ELA and math scores even with Information and Communication Technology used as a resource. This outcome impacts social change by answering a question about whether Information and Communication Technology made a difference as used, and indicates that other studies must be done to better understand why Information and Communication Technology was not successful or how it can be used to significantly improve inclusion student outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to meta-analyze single-case experimental designs that implemented schema instruction with students identified with disabilities. A total of 16 studies, with 61 students identified with disabilities met the inclusion criteria. Tau U was used to report intervention effects; this decision was made because it is more robust than other nonoverlap methods and is frequently reported in published meta- analyses of single-case experimental designs. Moderator analyses included grade of participants, use of technology, disability category, and the type of problems taught.

This technology may also be beneficial for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities as it can promote high levels of engagement with the learning task and an inclusive learning environment. However, few studies have measured extent of learning for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities pupils when using interactive apps, so it has yet to be determined if this technology is effective at raising attainment for these pupils. We report the first observational study of a group of 33 pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities from two primary schools in Malawi that are implementing a new digital technology intervention which uses touch-screen tablets to deliver interactive apps designed to teach basic mathematical skills. The apps contain topics that align to the national curriculum. To assess learning gains, rate of progress (minutes per topic) for each pupil was determined by calculating the average time taken to complete a topic. Progress rate was then correlated with teacher ratings of extent of disability and independent ratings of pupil engagement with the apps. Results showed Special Educational Needs and Disabilities pupils could interact with the apps and all pupils passed at least one topic. Average progress rate for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities pupils was twice as long as mainstream peers. Stepwise regression revealed extent of disability significantly predicted progress rate. Further exploratory correlations revealed pupils with moderate to severe difficulties with hearing and/or language made slower progress through the apps than those with greater functionality in these two domains because the use of verbal instructions within the apps limited their capacity to learn. This original quantitative analysis demonstrates that interactive apps can raise learning standards in pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities but may have limited utility for pupils with severe difficulties. Software modifications are needed to address specific areas of difficulty preventing pupils from progressing."

Methods: Eleven teachers of visually impaired students participated in focus groups. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Themes were identified. Results: The teachers described the importance of individualizing instruction for the student, teaching a systematic approach, and ensuring that graphics are clear to them. Discussion: From an early age, visually impaired students need explicit instruction in how to access information in graphics. The use of prescribed low vision devices, manipulatives, and systematic instruction are integral to student success, as are the design and production of clear and accurate graphics. Implications for practitioners: Teachers of visually impaired students utilize a variety of strategies to support students in accessing information in graphics. A curriculum and guidelines to assist them in supporting a wide range of learners would be valuable to the field of vision loss. "

To combat these students’ struggles, researchers have studied various pedagogical practices and classroom technologies for teaching standards covered in subjects such as algebra and geometry. However, as the role of computer- and tablet-based technologies in education grows, some areas of study, such as the use of virtual manipulatives, lack exploration. This study sought to assess the benefits of virtual manipulatives to teach secondary students with a learning disability in mathematics how to solve multistep algebraic equations. A multiple baseline design across three participants demonstrated a functional relation between the use of a virtual manipulative balance and teaching students to acquire, maintain, and generalize the skill of solving multistep algebraic equations. Results provide new evidence demonstrating virtual manipulatives as a beneficial age-appropriate technology to teach higher order mathematical concepts to secondary students with a learning disability.

For students with a learning disability, the need for such solutions is vital to address many of the academic struggles they face in the area of mathematics education. One evidence-based strategy shown to support instruction for students with a learning disability is the use of manipulatives. Although concrete manipulatives were extensively studied for this population, the virtual form of this technology lacks comparable research. Using a multiple probe design across three secondary students with a learning disability in mathematics, this study assessed the benefits of an instructional strategy using a virtual manipulative balance paired with explicit instruction to teach multistep linear equations. Results showed increased percent accuracy and independence scores for all three students across an intervention and maintenance phase. These findings and their broader implications for the field of mathematics education are discussed. "

Science, technology, engineering and mathematics education in many classrooms now includes digitally based activities such as science simulations and virtual laboratories that have been shown in some cases to promote learning gains. When such technologies are used in science, technology, engineering and mathematics assessments, a major challenge is to ensure assessments are accessible so all students can show what they know and can do. Federal laws and regulations including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Elementary & Secondary Education Act, and Americans with Disabilities Act require that students with disabilities (students with disabilities) be provided an opportunity to participate in educational programing and services available to nondisabled peers. In addition to implementing principles of universal design in assessment contexts, reasonable accommodations must be afforded to ensure accessibility. This article focuses on universal design and accommodations where the science, technology, engineering and mathematics construct is not adjusted or modified. Here, we employ synthesis of the research literature to document accessibility recommendations and practices around interactive assessment tasks, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We illustrate with an example and highlight directions that future development might take. The intention is to inform educators, school administrators, state and local policy makers, and assessment developers on the availability and use of accommodations in interactive assessment contexts such as simulation, and what is needed to ensure appropriate accessibility for students with disabilities.

People with print disabilities rely heavily on speech for information input. Mathematical expressions transmitted through typical spoken language are replete with multiple interpretations. These ambiguities create a substantial burden for the acquisition of basic mathematics and of knowledge from fields requiring a strong foundation in mathematics such as science, technology, and engineering. MathSpeak is based on a set of rules for conveying mathematical expressions in a non-ambiguous manner. The MathSpeak technology contains a computerised component that can easily and rapidly translate science, technology, engineering and mathematics materials into the non-ambiguous MathSpeak form, which can then be converted to an auditory rendering via a custom-designed high-quality computer-synthesised voice. This technology has great potential for increasing the accessibility to science, technology, engineering and mathematics materials and careers in related fields as shown by the efficacy studies. "

The intervention involved teaching a peer without a disability to encourage the student with autism to use the speech generating device during partnered mathematics activities. Our analysis involved visual and descriptive examination of trends and patterns over time, and comparison of means between and within phases. We found during the course of this study that (1) the student with autism's level of overall communication, which included the relevancy of these communicative behaviors, increased; (2) the student with autism's level of spontaneous communication acts increased; and (3) the peer became more independent with supporting the student with autism's communication.

Teachers are adapting their lessons to integrate calculators and calculator instruction. This study examined if the use of graphing calculators improved the achievement of students with and without disabilities in integrated co-teaching, general education, special classes, and accelerated classes. This study was conducted in a public high school in suburban New York on Long Island. The participants of this study were in 11 algebra classes which consisted of a total of 83 students (44 males and 39 females). Of the 191 students who were invited to participate in the study, consent was received from 83. Of the 83 participants, 18 students were classified with disabilities. The disabilities consisted of the following: Learning disability, other health impairment, and speech and language impairment. During the study, a pre-and-post-test quasi-experimental design model was used over the course of one unit, over four weeks. A series of lessons used during the course of the school year, incorporated the graphing calculator in order to improve not only the students' motivation in mathematics, but also, students' comprehension of the curriculum. Results from this study show that there was no significant difference between students who utilized the graphing calculator and those who did not use the graphing calculator. However, results indicated that the graphing calculator increased students' achievement in the all class models; that anticipated outcome occurred as was demonstrated by the scores on assessments. In addition, significant difference was found between gain scores of males and females with female students higher gain scores. Students with disabilities gained less than those without disabilities. Significant difference was noted in classroom setting with special education and regular education, special education and accelerated, and special education and information and communication technology. Other classroom settings which demonstrated a significant difference was regular education and information and communication technology classes and accelerated classes and information and communication technology classes. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of the use of the graphing calculator for specific sub group of students on increasing mean scores for students with and without disabilities in the high school setting and the importance of technology in mathematics education.

In this effort, the role of technology in the classroom, both highand low-tech, has gained significant attention for students with disabilities. The use of manipulatives is a form of technology with an established research base. Although concrete manipulatives in instructional practice have been thoroughly studied, the emergence of virtual manipulatives presents teachers with new options for teaching mathematics to elementary and secondary students. This article focuses the use of virtual manipulatives for students with disabilities while highlighting the benefits they pose, such a providing students with flexible options for learning, promoting student autonomy, and offering educators a wider range of options. In the study, the number of correct answers given to the area and volume questions related to the cube, square and rectangular prisms by the virtual teaching material were examined in 3 students with hyperactivity accompanying the Learning Difficulties. In the research conducted with the multiple probe across participants design, it is possible to say that the implementation of teaching through virtual reality platforms supports the continuation of attention to a certain point and it provides an advantage by having fun applications and increasing the number of correct responses to the geometry problems.

We conducted a systematic review to examine the effects of interventions delivered with manipulatives on the learning of children with mathematics learning disabilities. The outcomes observed in the sample (N?=?38) were learning, maintenance, and transfer in a variety of mathematical domains. Interventions using manipulatives were reported to be effective for a range of learning objectives (e.g., conceptual understanding and computational fluency), but several methodological weaknesses were observed. Analyses also highlighted considerable heterogeneity in the studies reviewed in terms of participant characteristics, intervention approaches, and methodology. We discuss overall effects of interventions with manipulatives in the mathematics learning disabilities population, the methodological quality across the sample, and implications for practice. "

Such a condition is not easily detected and most of them would be left undetected, apart from being labelled as lazy or slow learners. Early delay places them behind in acquiring other fundamental areas of Mathematics. As such, this study identified learners suffering from dyscalculia (also known as acalculia) through screening tests for early intervention. The methodology used in this study was based on two screening tests (ST1 and ST2) conducted on learners to identify 'student areas' or their specific type of dyscalculia using the Dyscalculia Screening Test Instrument and verification of the specific types made by selected expert teachers, respectively. An early identification study on suitable assistive learning technology for these learners was performed. Prior studies reported that suitable assistive technological tools can improve the learning process of those with learning disability. The findings displayed the effectiveness of the screening tests (ST1 and ST2) in detecting learners with dyscalculia, particularly in areas related to memory, abstraction, sequencing processing, motor, and visual perception. The results derived from plausible assistive digital technology revealed that visual-based fusion technology, such as augmented reality, exposed the dyscalculia learners to experiential learning approach that made learning Mathematics meaningful."

Maintenance of mathematical skills is especially important as mathematics has applications in daily life and is directly related to important life skills such as purchasing, calculating tips, and budgeting. In addition, maintenance of basic mathematical skills is necessary for advancing to higher grade-level contents because mathematical contents build upon previous contents. This dissertation is comprised of three stand-alone but inter-related studies that explored the maintenance of mathematical skills among students with disabilities. The researcher conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding attention to maintenance when exploring mathematical interventions for students with intellectual disability and autism. The researcher then conducted two original studies, each which examined the effectiveness of an intervention package--the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with fading support and the Virtual-representational-abstract with overlearning--to promote maintenance of basic operations skills among students with disabilities. In the first study, to determine the extent to which researchers focused on skill maintenance in teaching mathematics, the researcher reviewed all studies from 1975 to 2018 that involved teaching mathematics to individuals with developmental disabilities. A total of 128 studies met inclusion criteria but only 46 studies involved a maintenance phase (35.9%). Of the studies that included a maintenance phase, there was no consensus among researchers on the standards for conducting a maintenance phase. The most widely taught mathematical content was numbers and operations. All studies employed intervention packages which included more than one instructional method and/or materials and the most widely used instructional method was prompting while the most widely used instructional materials were visual supports. The second study was an experimental research study which used a multiple probe across participants design to examine the effectiveness of the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with fading support in teaching subtraction with regrouping to four students with disabilities, including intellectual disability and/or autism. A functional relation was found between the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with fading support and students' accuracy in solving the problems. Students also maintained the skill up to six weeks after the intervention. The third study also utilized a multiple probe across participants design to evaluate the effectiveness of the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with overlearning in teaching multiplication to three students with disabilities. A functional relation existed between the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with overlearning and accuracy of solving multiplication problems. Students also maintained the skill up to eight weeks after the intervention. Overall, in this dissertation, intervention packages including more than one instructional, or a combination of instructional methods and materials were not only effective for skill acquisition, but also for skill maintenance. The review of literature identified explicit instruction with visual supports, manipulatives, or task analysis as potentially beneficial packages for promoting maintenance while the experimental studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence with fading support or overlearning.

Consequently, the Office for Students (the UK government's higher education regulator) are funding 17 projects to address these inequalities. Building on its expertise, our institution is leading the IncSTEM project alongside colleagues from two other universities, to evaluate, scale up and promote inclusive teaching and learning practice within Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines in higher education. There are challenges with inclusive distance learning, many of which are emphasised in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics through the prevalence of practical and field activities, the widespread use of groupwork, and the use of text that is rich in symbolic notation. Online and blended learning approaches, including access to digital learning resources, bring opportunities for more inclusive practice, but can also lead to unforeseen and unquantified barriers for students. Integrating an inclusive approach to teaching and learning requires universities to embed and sustain practices that consider the diverse needs of students throughout curriculum design and delivery, bringing benefits to all students. In this paper, we present data on staff perceptions and practices regarding accessibility and inclusion for disabled students, explore examples of inclusive practice, and discuss how these can be applied by practitioners in order to create a higher education environment in which students of all backgrounds and characteristics are able to succeed."

However, there is a gap in the literature regarding video-based intervention, such as video modeling, as an evidence-based practice for academic skills. As technology becomes more and more integrated into U.S. classrooms each year, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Khan Academy videos are often used as supplemental resources by teachers to assist students with math work. The purposes of this study were to evaluate if in-class viewing of Khan Academy video models would increase math quiz performance for elementary age students with disabilities when used as a supplement to standard teacher instruction, to determine if the use of Khan Academy video models would decrease the total time required to complete a math quiz, and to evaluate the effects of behavioral skills training on math quiz scores in the event that Khan Academy was not effective. Results were evaluated using a non-concurrent multiple baseline across participants design and showed that overall, Khan Academy videos resulted in a slight increase in performance for two participants. The intervention was not effective for the other four. Overall, the duration to complete the quiz did not decrease with the implementation of Khan Academy. All 6 participants required behavioral skills training to increase their performances to mastery levels. "

Incorporation of the flipped classroom approach into the classroom which serves mainstreamed students with disabilities has not been widely studied. The purpose of the current study was to explore how mainstreamed students with disabilities in a mathematics classroom in a middle school in Northern California experience learning through the flipped classroom approach. A qualitative exploratory case study design was implemented to understand the experience of learning through the flipped classroom approach. The case included one school with four teachers, two administrators, and one special educator who implemented the flipped classroom approach and had students with disabilities enrolled. The thematic content analysis resulted in the identification of four major themes related to flipped classroom approach and students with disabilities including: the successes and struggles of student with disability learning as a result of flipped classroom approach; the conducive nature of flipped classroom approach to the provision of support to students; the benefits of flipped classroom approach learning activities for students; and teacher role in implementation of the flipped classroom approach for students. Additionally, two minor themes were identified: the impact the flipped classroom approach has on student attitude and the impact the flipped classroom approach has on motivation. Overall, students with disabilities experience improved learning as a result of the of flipped classroom approach learning activities. The current study added to the body of knowledge around the integration of technology into the classroom through the flipped classroom approach with the focus on the experience of learning of students with disabilities.

However, typical number lines lack concrete visual cues, which may benefit students with autism spectrum disorders who have not yet mastered the representation of Arabic numerals. Method: This study investigated the effects of additional visual cues (i.e., dots) by comparing two types of app-based number line conditions: number lines with and without dots. A single-subject, alternating treatment design study was employed across five secondary students with autism spectrum disorders. Results: Both number line conditions were effective for four of the students in assisting them to select cheaper items and complete task analysis steps. The number line with dots was effective or slightly more effective in selecting smaller numbers for three of the students. Conclusions: The findings of this study support the literature on the use of number lines as an effective tool to assist students in price comparison. The benefits of adding concrete visual cues and other teaching strategies (e.g., the holistic and decomposition models) were discussed. Implications for Rehabilitation: This study investigated the effectiveness of concrete visual cues, such as dots, on a number line app for teaching students with autism spectrum disorders who had not yet developed the association of quantities with the numerals. We found that incorporation of a hybrid number comparison model?–?first holistic (for whole numbers) and then decomposition (for numbers after the decimal point)?–?is effective when teaching students how to compare prices with an uneven number of digits.

The problem was the lack of prior research on the effects of assistive technology in primary education for the Deaf in Namibia, for guiding Namibian special primary schools and educators. Aim: The aim was to investigate the effects of Constructivism-led AT on the teaching and learning of learners who were deaf, in a mathematics class at a rural special primary school. Setting: The study involved Grade three children who were deaf. Grade 3 is where children learn to build and understand foundational and basic mathematical concepts, such as counting, which they require for subsequent mathematics learning and practice. Methods: The study was a mixed-methods study comprising a quantitative experiment and qualitative interviews. Results: The findings suggested that the Constructivism-led assistive technology may have had a positive effect on the children's multiplication and division achievement, but not on their addition and subtraction achievement. The teachers were positive about the Constructivism-led assistive technology and indicated that it supported collaborating, cooperating, exploring, self-assessing, learning from errors, seeking knowledge independently, self-regulating, self-reflecting, metacognitive thinking and being self-aware. Conclusion: For school management and teachers of children who are deaf, the study offered an intervention for potentially improving teaching and their learners' mathematics achievement. In addition, the study provided valuable evidence for policymakers about integrating technology for effective learning environments."

As algebra is considered to be the gatekeeper to higher level mathematics and beyond, it is essential for teachers to use effective practices, including the use of manipulatives, to support student learning. This alternative dissertation is comprised of three studies that explored teaching algebra to secondary students with high-incidence disabilities. The first was an evidence-based systematic review of literature investigating instructional practices to teach algebra to secondary students with high-incidence disabilities. Twenty studies published from 1999-2019 were reviewed and analyzed, of which 14 met the standards of high quality set by the Council for Exceptional Children, and five practices earned the label of potentially evidence-based (i.e., concrete-representational-abstract framework, manipulatives, enhanced anchor instruction, schema based instruction, and peer-assisted learning strategies). The second study used an alternating treatment design to compare the effectiveness of concrete algebra tiles to virtual algebra tiles to support middle school students with disabilities as they solved linear equations. Students were successful solving linear equations regardless of the type of manipulative they used, but preferred using the virtual tool. The final study used a multiple probe across behaviors, replicated across participant design to examine the effectiveness of the virtual-abstract framework to support secondary students with high-incidence disabilities in their acquisition of algebra skills. A functional relationship existed between the virtual-abstract framework and student performance on algebra probes, and students scored better on maintenance probes compared to baseline data. While there remains a need for more high-quality research examining effective practices in supporting secondary students with high-incidence disabilities in the area of algebra, the studies in this alternative dissertation suggest manipulatives, both as a stand-alone tool and as part of a process is an effective, and efficient intervention.

This study explored the effect of a treatment package--an app-based virtual manipulative (Cuisenaire® Rods) in conjunction with explicit instruction--on students' acquisition and generalization of solving problems involving division of whole numbers with remainders. Three middle school students with disabilities participated in this multiple baseline, multiple probe across participants single case design study. Each of the students acquired the mathematical behavior of being able to solve division with remainders problems. In other words, a functional relation existed between the intervention package of explicit instruction and the Cuisenaire® Rods app-based manipulative and students' accuracy in solving division with remainders problems. Yet, two students failed to generalize the skill without the explicit instruction and use of the app-based manipulative."

Even simple addition problems require prerequisite skills that are often not taught directly in schools. Identifying and teaching those missing skills would reduce the learning gap and increase the lifelong independence of those learners. This study used a nonconcurrent single-subject multiple baseline design across five learners with a pretest/posttest analysis to examine the use of a norm-referenced, standardized assessment to identify gaps in student learning, create teaching protocols using video modeling, and assess overall growth after intervention. Individualized interventions were delivered using video models on iPads. Results indicated all learners were able to use the video models to acquire the missing skills and improve overall mathematics understanding, as measured by scores on a posttest. This has classroom implications due to the relative ease of administration of the assessment and teaching protocol as well as the potential for improved outcomes for the learners."

In the field of mathematics, virtual manipulatives are a research-based tool that has shown to have a positive impact on students' mathematic achievement, as well as student engagement in learning. In an effort to extend the research, this study investigated the impact of virtual manipulatives, when paired with research- (i.e., story-based math lessons) and evidence-based practices (i.e., systematic instruction, graphic organizers, manipulatives). This study used a single-case multiple probe across early numeracy math skills, with replication across student design. Two elementary students with autism and moderate intellectual disability used virtual manipulatives embedded within a story context to gain three early numeracy skills (i.e., set making, measurement, pattern making). Visual analysis of baseline, intervention, and maintenance phase data indicated a functional relationship between the use of virtual manipulatives and student math skills, and statistical analysis (Tau-U) further supported this with a large effect. Additionally, the virtual manipulatives were found to be more engaging than the tangible math manipulatives. Students were able to generalize and maintain the early numeracy skills across new math contexts. Implications and recommendations for practice and future research are provided. "

G.",2020,Using Blended Learning to Improve the Mathematics Achievement of Students with High Incidence Disabilities in an Alternative Education School,Blended Learning.//High-Incidence Disabilities.//Alternative Education School.//Mathematics Achievement.//Emotional and Behavioral Disorders.//On-Task Behavior,"Students with high incidence disabilities in the public school system often perform multiple grade levels below their typically-developing peers in mathematics achievement. These students exhibit lower levels of on-task behavior that limits their access to effective instruction, thus requiring instructional interventions that personalize learning, differentiate materials, and ultimately promote academic engagement. In recent years, the use of technology-mediated and computer-assisted instruction has shown to have positive results with students with disabilities. Blended learning, an intervention that combines face-to-face instruction with computer-based instruction, has been shown to improve the on-task behavior and achievement of students with disabilities. In Chapter One, a systematic review of the literature was conducted in an effort to locate blended learning math studies for secondary-level students with disabilities and to assess the scientific rigor of those studies. Twelve intervention studies were synthesized and categorized in three major areas: (a) online- and computer-based curricula for independent practice/instruction, (b) media-based interventions with video prompting, and (c) strategy instruction. Blended learning intervention studies that found positive results in math achievement and on-task behavior of students with disabilities utilized a station-rotation format. Additionally, studies that met the high standards of special education research (CEC, 2014) saw stronger gains for student math achievement. In Chapter Two, blended learning was implemented with three middle school students with emotional behavior disorders in a therapeutic setting. Using a multiple baseline across participants single case design, this study examined the relationship between blended learning mathematics instruction and student on-task behavior, teacher engagement, and mathematics achievement. Both student and teacher engagement increased with the use of station-rotation blended learning. Math achievement, measured through the AIMSweb curriculum-based math probes, improved for two of three student participants. Social validity questionnaires revealed that students and teacher enjoyed the blended learning intervention; however, continued use depended on properly functioning technology. Future research in the area of blended learning math instruction should strive to accurately measure on- and off-task behavior under the computer-based condition. Additionally, researchers should develop measurements of math achievement that accurately assess the content that is taught during instruction."

This is especially difficult for visually impaired students because of difficulties in managing structural information included in maths formulae. Methods: The extended multimedia alternative method, including the problem of decomposition and knowledge vector, were presented and compared to the classical teaching method. A qualitative method to evaluate motivation during the process of teaching and learning maths for impaired students, which includes eleven detailed motivators, has been developed. Results: The alternative teaching method offers statistically significant improvements in four of the eleven proposed assessment categories: success in progress – adjusting the difficulties of learning, presentation of the material, approval: group/individual and alternative presentation of mathematic materials. The experiments carried out allowed the authors to increase the knowledge about the limitations and challenges occurring in the process of maths education among visually impaired students and their motivation. Conclusions: Based on the experiments and research results, it can be concluded that applying the proposed method of decomposition together with evaluation procedure based on the vector of knowledge in the process of teaching and learning of mathematics by visually impaired may increase their motivation positively. Implications for Rehabilitation: The key aspects of the alternative method of presenting math formulae are included in the bellow points: •It increases the availability of materials containing structured information (mathematical formulae) for the blind. •It limits the importance of communication barriers in math education: the possibility of self-study, reducing costs – by reducing the number of individual tutorials. •It contributes to the development of universal rules for the structural presentation of information •It increases the independence of the student from the teacher."

A total of 135 studies met inclusion criteria, but only 53 studies involved a maintenance phase (39.2%). Among the 53 studies, only 22 were included for the final analysis, after evaluating their methodological rigor. In those 22 studies, there was no consensus among researchers on the standards for conducting a maintenance phase (i.e., latency between intervention and maintenance phases, length of maintenance phase, number of maintenance sessions). Further, in the studies which included a maintenance phase, the most widely taught mathematical content was numbers and operations. All studies employed intervention packages which included more than one instructional method and/or materials and the most widely used instructional method was prompting while the most widely used instructional materials were visual supports and manipulatives. The results suggest that prompting is an evidence-based practice for individuals with intellectual disability in supporting maintenance, while explicit instruction, time delay, feedback, and instructional sequence (e.g., the Virtual-representational-abstract instructional sequence) are potentially evidence-based practice for individuals with intellectual disability.

The paper proposes novel sonification algorithms for converting colour and grayscale images into sound. The blind user can interactively explore image content through multi?touch gestures and select image sub?regions for sonification with real?time control of the synthesized sound parameters such as amplitude, frequency and timbre. Additionally, images may contain text fields read by text?to?speech synthesizer. The usability of one of the proposed sonification schemes is tested by collecting data on the tracking accuracy and recognition speed of basic shapes, such as lines, curves, as well as figures and simple functions. In order to facilitate the learning process for blind children, a number of games were proposed that use the devised sonification schemes. The first game—“Hear the Invisible”—is intended for two players—one child draws a shape and the task of the other one is to guess the displayed shape by means of the available sonification methods. The second proposed game is “Follow the Rabbit” and is intended for a single player who tracks a colourful “Rabbit” that runs along a path representing a given geometric shape. The obtained results show that the proposed sonification methods allow to reach previously unattainable levels of flexibility in exploration of shapes and colours. The main application of the described interactive tool is to teach geometry and mathematics in schools for blind children. The developed games are meant to enhance the learning process and motivate the children. Practitioner Notes What is known about the topic Sonification is a generic term for data?based non?speech sound generation. Interactive sonification is a relatively fresh area of study, where the listener heavily influences the process of sound synthesis. Earlier studies on sonification and educational computer games have shown that it is possible to demonstrate shapes such as plots and geometry using only non?verbal sounds. What the paper adds The paper proposes an interactive sonification algorithm that can be used on greyscale or colour images using additive synthesis and the HSV colour representation. The presented software also allows to record and analyse user interaction with the images, making it a good research tool for current and future sonification algorithms. The paper presents a pilot study with blind children using two games that improve the learning process of the proposed algorithms. Implications for practice and/or policy Once the software is openly released it can be easily installed on any Android OS device to allow blind users to analyse images by touch. The proposed games train the users the basics of the sonification algorithm in a competitive context. The software can be especially useful in education of blind children, eg, in teaching geometry, math and in training visual and spatial imagination."

The awareness about tactile and sound-based technology was good among students: Braille books (98%), Braille slate and stylus (99.2%), handheld audio recorders (77.6%) and screen readers (77.2%). Good awareness was reported for abacus (88.8%), walking long canes (94.4%) and smart cane (89.6%), audible balls (96%), Braille chess (82.8%) and talking watch (98%). Among the students with <6/18 to 1/60 vision, the awareness of visual based technology ranged from 0.8% (typoscope) to 43.6% (video magnifiers). Braille technology was used for reading by 96.4% (books) and for writing by 96.8% (Braille slate and stylus) irrespective of visual status. Other devices were poorly used ranging from nil (typoscope) to 55% (screen readers). The use of math and science learning devices was poor (<20%). Walking canes were used by 59% of students whereas 87.2% students used audible ball for games. Conclusion: The results showed that majority of students used tactile based technology irrespective of visual status. Students with visual disability need assistive technology for a wide range of activities including academic learning. Students in schools for the blind who have binocular best corrected vision acuity of 1/60 or better should be encouraged to use visual based assistive technology instead of tactile based. Students with binocular best corrected vision acuity less than1/60 should be encouraged to use other available tactile and sound-based assistive technologies as well as Braille books and Braille slate and stylus for their academic activities including maths and sciences. Teachers should be trained in the use of various assistive technologies for reading, writing, maths, sciences, sports, mobility and activities of daily living. "

For years, students have been instructed to close the gap in their educational needs based on the Individual Education Plan goals and objectives only and introducing students to an inclusionary form of education with typical peers in order to be exposed to grade-level curriculum. In this study, the expansion of ideas to move from inclusion as a proximity of the student to inclusion by instruction using grade-level materials, differentiation and accommodations in a smaller setting was reviewed. To decide on the effectiveness of the instruction, standardized measures, such as Measures of Academic Performance and statewide end of year testing was analyzed, using previous grade-level data comparing it with the current year data to determine growth. Participants in the study were fifth-grade students in a virtual setting, some who were new to virtual learning and/or inclusion, with academic needs in the areas of reading fluency, reading comprehension, mathematics, written expression and behavioral needs. This study focused solely on the impact of direct explicit instruction as it pertains to mathematics. The results of the study showed T-Value scores resulting in a significance at p < .01. Recommendations for further research includes looking at the instruction provided to students and not solely the proximity of the students to show gains in academics. "

The Please Go Bring Me-COnceptual Model-based Problem Solving program focused on enhancing the multiplicative reasoning and problem solving through nurturing fundamental mathematical ideas and moving students above and beyond the concrete level of operation. This is achieved by taking advantages of the constructivist approach from mathematics education and explicit conceptual model-based problem solving approach from special education. Participants were three elementary students with learning disabilities (LD). A mixed method design was employed to investigate the effect of the Please Go Bring Me-COnceptual Model-based Problem Solving program on enhancing students’ multiplicative reasoning and problem solving. It was found that the Please Go Bring Me-COnceptual Model-based Problem Solving program significantly improved participating students’ problem solving performance not only on researcher developed criterion tests but also on a norm-referenced standardized test. Qualitative and quantities data from this study indicate that, in addition to nurturing fundamental concept of composite units, it is necessary to help students to understand underlying problem structures and move toward mathematical model-based problem representation and solving for generalized problem solving skills.

If learning disabilities are not detected early and addressed through appropriate interventions, they have a heavy impact on these children in the social, educational, and professional spheres, at great cost to society. The Batterie Modulable de Tests informatisée, or ""computerized Adaptable Test Battery"" enables fast, easy, reliable assessments for each cognitive domain. It has previously been validated in children ages 4-13 who had no prior complaints. The present study demonstrates the sensitivity of the computerized Adaptable Test Battery , relative to reference test batteries, for 191 children with cognitive difficulties. Materials and Methods: These 191 subjects were included in the study by the 14 pediatricians treating them for complaints in five cognitive domains: written language [60 (cases)]; mathematical cognition (40); oral language (60); handwriting, drawing, and visuospatial construction (45); and attention and executive functioning (45). In accordance with a predefined protocol, the children were administered computerized Adaptable Test Battery tests first, by their pediatricians, and reference tests later, by specialists to whom the computerized Adaptable Test Battery test results were not disclosed. Comparison of computerized Adaptable Test Battery and reference test results made it possible to evaluate sensitivity and agreement between tests. Results: For each of the five domains, the computerized Adaptable Test Battery was very sensitive (0.91-1), and normal computerized Adaptable Test Battery results were highly predictive of normal results for specialized reference tests [negative likelihood ratio (LR-): 0-0.16]. There was close agreement between computerized Adaptable Test Battery and reference tests in all domains except attention and executive functioning, for which only moderate agreement was observed. Conclusion: The computerized Adaptable Test Battery offers rapid, reliable, simple computerized assessments whose sensitivity and agreement with reference test batteries make it a suitable first-line instrument for learning disability screening in children 4-13 years old."

In one condition, teachers used technology-assisted prompts to assess student performance and remediate errors. In the comparison condition, teachers gave students the same items for assessing progress but used their own methods of reteaching. Results indicated no difference between the two methods. However, pretest-to-posttest gain scores were significantly higher on all three measures regardless of type of formative assessment, and students maintained much of what they had learned. Phase 2 examined issues related to instructional dosage. Students who received additional weeks of instruction scored significantly higher than students who went back to their business-as-usual curriculum. "

The study includes an analysis of the relationship between scale scores and time spent using the IXL system, number of problems attempted, and skills mastered. This study is significant because national, state and local measures indicate no measurable improvement in math achievement with an alarming percentage of students scoring below proficient levels. Further, past studies examined teacher perception or student motivation regarding educational technology and achievement. To date, is the only study independently analyzing the effectiveness of a widely-used online learning application, IXL Math, in a Title 1 urban Middle School consisting of 6th, 7th and 8th grade students and measuring the impact of the online program on students most at-risk, and whose attributes comprise the lowest third percentile of achievers. A quasi-experimental research design was conducted by comparing two distinct cohorts of students—one using traditional paper assignments and the other completing IXL online assignments, and using statistical analysis, a determination was made that there was no significant difference in the scale scores between the two groups. Additionally, the interaction between IXL and gender, ethnicity, and disability, and its effect on math scores was analyzed. Two-way analysis of variance tests and Pearson's correlation were conducted using SPSS software package. The major findings are discussed offering recommendations for future practice and research. "

The aim is to design an alternative way to teach the subject, and to explore its effects on the learning processes. Geometric construction is an important element in the curriculum in primary and secondary school, but is not an end in itself. We draw upon Efraim Fischbein's work, in particular the link between the figural and conceptual aspects of geometric objects, in order to design a simulator that can execute geometrical constructions for students with motor co-ordination problems, who find drawing difficult. Our initial experiment with students with dyspraxia and their peers showcases the potential benefits of alternating human--human and human--avatar dyads. It serves as a proof of concept and highlights the way in which students appropriate the artifact and construct an instrument in the context of drawing."

Students in rural areas, however, have tended to receive far less technology-infused instruction due to the many challenges faced by rural schools that can adversely affect academic opportunities and disrupt equity in learning and teaching. In the current paper, we report on a classroom study conducted to examine whether the previously proven effects of concrete manipulatives can carry over into those of virtual manipulatives when teaching math fact fluency in multiplication and explored the potential for virtual manipulatives in rural classrooms from the teacher’s perspective.  Quantitative and qualitative results both indicated a promising potential for usage of virtual manipulatives, with meaningful implications for practitioners. The educational implications for designing and planning effective instruction incorporating virtual manipulatives are discussed."

Technology-enhanced teaching resources (e.g. Code-a-pillar, Bee-Bot, Kubo) provide coding opportunities that engage young children in problem solving, planning, and organization. These tools provide kinesthetic experiences in the exploration of early numeracy skills like counting, addition, subtraction, and estimation. The present article provides a rationale for including 21st-century teaching practices and educational technology resources in preschool classrooms with deaf and hard of hearing children as one path toward strengthening early mathematics understanding. The authors also offer tips for teachers on how to select technology tools for classroom use and ways to integrate the use of these tools as part of meaningful mathematics instruction. "

Ms. Montes was interviewed twice during this period. Data were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Pre-COVID, Ms. Montes provided her students daily opportunities to tackle challenging mathematical problems and taught self-regulation strategies for students to better understand themselves as learners. After the shift to Emergency Remote Teaching, Ms. Montes described “the wall between us” as various barriers that made teaching mathematics online far more challenging. Challenges included supporting students with productive struggle when not physically present with them and supporting student self-regulation during mathematical problem-solving. Supporting students with disabilities to learn mathematics during Emergency Remote Teaching and distance learning will require considering emotional and affective dimensions of learning. Coaching students and families in self-regulation strategies could support student engagement in mathematical problem-solving in online learning."

It has been demonstrated that The Number Race, a non-commercial adaptive computer game designed to foster basic mathematical abilities, represents a promising instrument to enhance these skills in children with Down Syndrome when delivered by an expert in a clinical setting.; Aims: In the present study, we assessed the efficacy of The Number Race when administered at home by properly instructed and remotely supervised parents.; Methods and Procedures: Basic numerical skills were assessed before and after training, as well as at three-months follow-up. Performance of children with Down Syndrome who worked at home with the parent (PG) was compared with that of children who received the training by an expert (EG). For both groups, the training lasted ten weeks, with two weekly sessions of 20-30 min.; Outcomes and Results: Results show that both groups improved across various measures of numerical proficiency, including the overall score of the numeracy assessment battery, while only the EG showed an improvement in a measure of mental calculation. The improvements were maintained three months after the end of the training.; Conclusions and Implications: These findings confirm the efficacy of The Number Race and extend it to an home-based setting, whereby parents administer the training with external supervision."

In this study, researchers compared the use of concrete - with scaffolds added by researchers - and virtual algebra tiles - with inherent scaffolds - to support the acquisition, fluency, and generalization of linear algebra for three middle school students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the single case alternating treatments design, all three participants were successful in solving two-step addition and subtraction linear algebra problems with both manipulative types. Students were successful in best treatment sessions, but struggled to generalize to solving the problems without the use of the either manipulative. This study contributes to the limited literature on algebra instruction for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities and suggests both concrete and virtual algebra tiles can successful support students with linear algebra."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of fraction intervention that pair virtual manipulatives with instructional lessons featuring explicit instruction in synchronous online learning for fifth grade students with mathematics learning disabilities. A multiple probe baseline design across subjects was employed for the study. Three fifth-grade students with mathematics learning disabilities received explicit instruction in synchronous online learning via video conferencing programs. During the intervention, students received the 15 fraction lessons using virtual manipulatives in synchronous online learning environment. The participants’ percentages of correct answers on the researcher-developed probe were measured across baseline, intervention, and maintenance phases. After the intervention, the participants completed a social validity questionnaire which examined their perceptions of the online intervention using virtual manipulatives. The findings of the study showed that students' performance improved when the intervention was introduced, and that there was a functional relationship between the fraction intervention and students’ accuracy in solving problems on equivalent fractions. Specifically, the average performance levels across all participants increased from the baseline to the intervention phase (by 18.33% to 20%) with high effect sizes (PND of 80%-100%, NAP of 0.94-1.00, and Tau-U of 0.88-1.00).

And the sudden shift from face-to-face classes to online instructional delivery due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to them. Hence, this qualitative descriptive-exploratory case study was undertaken to explore the response of a learner with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in mathematics towards a synchronous online Orton-Gillingham Math intervention in terms of working behavior. The participant was chosen purposively based on the diagnosis, arithmetic calculation level, and unfamiliarity with the Orton-Gillingham-Math intervention. The participant was taught using the Orton-Gillingham-Math approach via an online platform for twice-a-week for 4 weeks. The online classes were recorded then transcribed with consent from the participant’s parent and school. The data were analyzed using trustworthy thematic analysis to ensure validity and reliability. The analysis revealed five (5) emerging themes namely symptoms of inattention, symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, lowered vigilance, emotional understanding and reactivity, and active class participation. Despite the existence of these responses, the participant was still able to participate actively in synchronous online class and showed emotional competence. It can be concluded that learner-participant with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in math can thrive in synchronous online class given her short attention span."

It is therefore not unexpected that many children struggle to stay at grade level, and this becomes especially difficult when several abilities from both domains are impaired, as in the case of mathematical learning disabilities. Surprisingly, although mathematical learning disabilities is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders affecting schoolchildren, most of the diagnostic instruments available do not include assessment of domain-general and domain-specific skills. Furthermore, very few are computerized. To the best of our knowledge, there is no tool with these features for Spanish-speaking children. The purpose of this study was to describe the protocol for the diagnosis of Spanish mathematical learning disabilities children using the BM-PROMA multimedia battery. BM-PROMA facilitates the evaluation of both skill domains, and the 12 tasks included for this purpose are empirically evidence-based. The strong internal consistency of BM-PROMA and its multidimensional internal structure are demonstrated. BM-PROMA proves to be an appropriate tool for diagnosing children with mathematical learning disabilities during primary education. It provides a broad cognitive profile for the child, which will be relevant not only for diagnosis but also for individualized instructional planning."
